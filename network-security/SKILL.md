## Skill Description
Network Security involves protecting computer networks from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure. It encompasses technologies, processes, and practices designed to secure network infrastructure and data transmitted across networks.

## Core Competencies

### 1. **Network Architecture & Design**
- Secure network segmentation and zoning
- Defense-in-depth strategies
- Zero Trust Architecture principles
- Secure network topology design

### 2. **Perimeter Security**
- Firewall configuration and management (stateful/stateless, next-gen)
- Intrusion Prevention/Detection Systems (IPS/IDS)
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- VPN technologies and secure remote access

### 3. **Network Monitoring & Analysis**
- Network traffic analysis and baselining
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Packet capture and analysis (Wireshark, tcpdump)
- Anomaly detection and behavioral analysis

### 4. **Protocol Security**
- Secure protocol implementation (TLS/SSL, SSH, IPsec)
- DNS security (DNSSEC, DNS filtering)
- Email security protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Wireless security (WPA3, 802.1X)

### 5. **Access Control & Authentication**
- Network Access Control (NAC)
- 802.1X authentication
- RADIUS/TACACS+ implementation
- Privileged access management

## Practical Applications

### Hands-On Projects

#### **Project 1: Home Lab Network Security**
- **Objective**: Build and secure a small network environment
