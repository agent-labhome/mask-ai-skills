## Overview
Goal setting is the systematic process of identifying what you want to achieve and establishing measurable objectives and timeframes to accomplish them. Effective goal setting transforms vague aspirations into actionable plans, increasing motivation and the likelihood of success by 42% according to research.

## Core Principles

### 1. **SMART Framework**
Goals should be:
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous, and detailed
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable with concrete criteria
- **Achievable**: Realistic and attainable
- **Relevant**: Aligned with your values and larger objectives
- **Time-bound**: With a defined deadline

### 2. **Goal Hierarchy**
- **Vision** (5-10 years): Broad life direction
- **Long-term goals** (1-5 years): Major milestones
- **Short-term goals** (3-12 months): Stepping stones
- **Actionable tasks** (Daily-weekly): Immediate steps

### 3. **Balance**
Effective goal setting considers multiple life domains:
- Career/Professional
- Health/Fitness
- Relationships
- Personal Development
- Financial
- Leisure/Recreation
