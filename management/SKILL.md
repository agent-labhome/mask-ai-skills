## Purpose
A management brief is a concise, structured document that presents key information, analysis, and recommendations to senior leadership to support rapid, informed decision-making.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity Over Completeness:** Prioritize the most critical information; exhaustive detail belongs in appendices or backup materials.
- **Action-Oriented:** Every brief should drive toward a clear decision, approval, or direction.
- **Audience-Centric:** Tailor content, depth, and language to the specific knowledge and needs of the executives receiving it.
- **Forward-Looking:** Focus on implications, options, and the path forward, not just a report of past events.

## Structure of a Standard Management Brief
