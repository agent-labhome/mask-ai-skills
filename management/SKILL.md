## Purpose
A management brief is a concise, structured communication tool designed to inform decision-makers about critical information, enabling rapid understanding and action. It distills complex situations into essential elements for executives and senior leaders who need to make informed decisions with limited time.

## Core Principles

*   **Clarity Over Completeness:** Prioritize the most critical information. Omit unnecessary detail that does not directly support the decision or understanding required.
*   **Audience-Centric:** Tailor content, tone, and depth to the specific knowledge level and needs of the leadership audience.
*   **Action-Oriented:** Every brief should drive toward a clear purpose: a decision, an approval, awareness of a risk, or alignment on next steps.
*   **Structured for Speed:** Use consistent formatting (like BLUF) and clear headings so key information can be found in seconds.

## Standard Structure (BLUF Format)
