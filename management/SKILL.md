## Purpose
Deliver concise, actionable management summaries that enable rapid, informed decision-making.

## Key Principles

**Clarity Over Completeness**
- Lead with the single most important conclusion
- Use plain language, avoid jargon
- Structure: Situation → Analysis → Recommendation

**Brevity as Discipline**
- One page maximum for written briefs
- 5 minutes maximum for verbal briefs
- Include only decision-critical information
- Append supporting data, don't embed it

**Action Orientation**
- Every brief must end with clear options
- Specify recommended action and rationale
- Define decision deadline and stakeholders
- Outline next steps and owners
