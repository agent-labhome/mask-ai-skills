## Purpose
A management brief is a concise, structured communication that presents key information, analysis, and recommendations to senior leadership to support rapid, informed decision-making.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity Over Completeness:** Prioritize the most critical information. The goal is insight, not exhaustive detail.
- **Audience-Centric:** Tailor content, depth, and language to the specific knowledge and needs of the executives.
- **Action-Oriented:** Every brief should drive toward a clear decision, approval, or direction.
- **Brevity with Substance:** Be succinct but never superficial. Every sentence must carry weight.

## Structure (The \"BLUF\" Method - Bottom Line Up Front)
A standard brief follows this flow:

1.  **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (BLUF):** The single most important section. State the core issue, recommended action, and key rationale in 3-5 sentences.
2.  **BACKGROUND/C"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
