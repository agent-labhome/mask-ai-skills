## Purpose
Deliver concise, actionable management updates that drive decisions.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity Over Completeness**: Lead with the conclusion, not the journey.
- **Action-Oriented**: Every brief must have a clear \"So what?\" and \"Now what?\"
- **Audience-First**: Tailor depth and detail to the reader's needs and time.
- **Data-Anchored**: Support assertions with key metrics, not just opinion.

## Structure (The 5-Slide Rule)
1. **Headline**: The single core message or decision required.
2. **Situation**: 2-3 bullet points on current state/context.
3. **Key Data**: 1-3 critical metrics or findings. Use visuals.
4. **Options/Implications**: Brief analysis of paths forward or consequences.
5. **Recommendation & Next Steps**: Clear ask and immediate actions.
