## Purpose
A **Management Brief** is a concise, structured communication tool designed to inform senior leaders and decision-makers about critical information, enabling rapid understanding and action. It distills complex situations into essential elements, providing clarity without unnecessary detail.

## Core Principles

**1. Audience-Centric**
- Tailor content to the specific executive’s priorities and knowledge level.
- Anticipate key questions: \"So what?\" and \"What do you need from me?\"

**2. Concise & Scannable**
- Adhere strictly to length limits (typically 1 page).
- Use clear headings, bullet points, and white space.
- Lead with the most critical information (BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front).

**3. Action-Oriented**
- Clearly state the purpose: to inform, seek a decision, or request resources.
- Provide actionable recommendations with clear rationale.

**4. Objective & Evidence-Based**
- Separate facts from analysis and opinion"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
