## Core Principle
**Food is a skill, not just consumption.** Approach it with intention, curiosity, and respect for its role in health, culture, and connection.

## Key Practices

### 1. **Eat Mindfully**
*   **Pause before eating.** Acknowledge the effort and resources that brought the food to you.
*   **Engage your senses.** Notice colors, aromas, textures, and flavors.
*   **Eat slowly.** Put your utensil down between bites. This aids digestion and increases satisfaction.

### 2. **Cook Fundamentally**
Master a few core techniques that unlock countless meals:
*   **Sauté** aromatics (onion, garlic).
*   **Roast** vegetables and proteins.
*   **Simmer** a soup, stew, or sauce.
*   **Prepare** a basic vinaigrette.
*   **Cook** grains (rice, quinoa) and legumes"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
