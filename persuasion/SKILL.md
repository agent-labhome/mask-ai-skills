## Overview
Persuasion is the art of influencing others' beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors through communication, without coercion or manipulation. It combines logical argumentation, emotional connection, and ethical appeal to create mutually beneficial outcomes.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Ethical Foundation**
- Persuasion ≠ manipulation
- Aim for win-win outcomes
- Maintain integrity and transparency
- Respect autonomy and right to refuse

- **Pathos**: Emotional appeals connecting to values, fears, or desires
- **Ethos**: Credibility appeals based on character, expertise, or trustworthiness

- Social proof (people follow what others do)
- Consistency (people want to align with past commitments)
- Liking (people are more persuaded by those they like)
- Authority (people defer to experts)
