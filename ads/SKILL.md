# SKILL: Ads Brief

## Purpose
Create clear, actionable advertising briefs that align creative teams with business objectives.

## Core Components
1. **Objective** - What the ad must achieve (awareness, conversions, etc.)
2. **Target Audience** - Demographics, psychographics, behaviors
3. **Key Message** - Single compelling idea to communicate
4. **Brand Voice** - Tone and personality guidelines
5. **Mandatories** - Legal requirements, logos, disclaimers
6. **Success Metrics** - How performance will be measured

## Best Practices
- Start with the business problem, not creative ideas
- Be specific about what the audience should feel/do
- Include competitive context
- Keep it concise (1 page ideal)
- Distinguish between "must-have" and "nice-to-have"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Vague objectives ("increase awareness")
- Overloading with multiple messages
- Omitting measurement criteria
