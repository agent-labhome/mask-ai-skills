## Purpose
Create clear, actionable advertising briefs that align creative teams with business objectives.

## Core Elements
- **Objective**: Primary goal (awareness, conversion, etc.)
- **Target Audience**: Demographics, behaviors, pain points
- **Key Message**: Single compelling takeaway
- **Brand Voice**: Tone and personality guidelines
- **Call-to-Action**: Desired user response
- **Specifications**: Format, duration, platform requirements
- **Success Metrics**: How performance will be measured

## Best Practices
- Start with the business problem, not creative ideas
- Keep it concise (1 page maximum)
- Include competitive context when relevant
- Distinguish \"must-have\" from \"nice-to-have\"
- Align all stakeholders before creative work begins

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Vague objectives (\"increase engagement\")
- Overly broad target audiences
- Multiple conflicting messages
