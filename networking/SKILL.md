**Purpose:** Building and maintaining professional relationships to exchange information, advice, and support.

**Core Actions:**
*   **Connect:** Proactively introduce yourself and find common ground.
*   **Listen:** Focus on understanding others' goals and challenges.
*   **Give:** Offer help, insights, or introductions without immediate expectation of return.
*   **Follow Up:** Maintain connections with a brief message or shared resource.
*   **Nurture:** Sustain relationships over time, not just when you need something.

**Key Mindset:** It's about cultivating a garden, not hunting. Value comes from mutual, long-term benefit.

**Quick Tip:** Your network is not your contact list; it's the people who know and are willing to help you."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":158,"total_tokens":173,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
