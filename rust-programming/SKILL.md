## Core Concepts
- **Ownership**: Unique value ownership system
- **Borrowing**: Immutable (&) and mutable (&mut) references
- **Lifetimes**: Explicit memory safety guarantees
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: High-level features with C-like performance

## Key Features
- Memory safe without garbage collection
- Fearless concurrency with compile-time guarantees
- Pattern matching and algebraic data types
- Cargo package manager and build system
- Traits for polymorphism and code reuse

## Common Use Cases
- Systems programming
- WebAssembly
- Command-line tools
- Network services
- Embedded systems

## Quick Start
```rust
fn main() {
