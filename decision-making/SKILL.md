**Core Definition:**  
The ability to analyze information, evaluate options, and choose a course of action to achieve a desired outcome.

**Key Components:**
1. **Problem Framing:** Clearly defining the issue, goals, and constraints.
2. **Information Gathering:** Collecting relevant data and perspectives.
3. **Option Analysis:** Weighing pros, cons, risks, and alignment with objectives.
4. **Commitment:** Making a timely choice and taking ownership.
5. **Review:** Evaluating outcomes and integrating lessons learned.

**In Practice:**
- Balances speed with thoroughness based on context.
- Distinguishes between reversible (\"two-way door\") and irreversible (\"one-way door\") decisions.
- Considers both data and intuition.
- Communicates the \"why\" behind the choice.

**Antipatterns:**
- Analysis paralysis.
- Deciding without necessary input.
- Impulsive choices without rationale.
- Avoiding decisions by default.
