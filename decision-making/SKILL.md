## Overview
Decision Making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action from multiple alternatives to achieve a desired outcome. It involves gathering information, evaluating options, and committing to a choice, often under conditions of uncertainty, time pressure, or conflicting priorities.

## Core Components

1.  **Problem Definition & Framing:** Clearly identifying the decision to be made, its scope, constraints, and desired objectives.
2.  **Information Gathering:** Researching, collecting relevant data, and seeking diverse perspectives to inform the choice.
3.  **Option Generation:** Brainstorming and identifying a range of possible alternatives or solutions.
4.  **Evaluation & Analysis:** Weighing the pros and cons of each option against criteria such as feasibility, impact, risk, resources, and alignment with goals.
5.  **Selection:** Choosing the most suitable alternative based on the evaluation.
6.  **Implementation & Action:** Executing the decision and allocating necessary resources.
