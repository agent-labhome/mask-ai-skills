## What It Is
The ability to choose the best course of action from available options, balancing speed, information, and impact.

## Key Behaviors
- **Defines the problem** clearly before seeking solutions
- **Gathers relevant data** but avoids \"analysis paralysis\"
- **Considers alternatives** and their potential consequences
- **Makes timely calls** even with incomplete information
- **Takes ownership** of decisions and their outcomes
- **Adjusts course** when new information warrants

## Quick Tips
- For low-stakes decisions: Decide fast, iterate later.
- For high-stakes decisions: Consult, analyze, then commit.
- Default to action when stuck—movement creates new data.
- \"Perfect\" is often the enemy of \"good enough to move forward.\"

## Signs of Strength
- Decisions are respected even when disagreed with
- Team operates with clarity and momentum
- Learns from outcomes without excessive regret
