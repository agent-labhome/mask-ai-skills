## Core Principles
- **Clarity First**: Define the problem clearly before seeking solutions
- **Options, then choice**: Generate multiple alternatives before deciding
- **Risk-aware**: Consider both upside potential and downside consequences
- **Timely**: Make decisions when needed, not prematurely or too late

## Quick Framework
1. **Frame**: What problem are we actually solving?
2. **Explore**: What are 3+ possible approaches?
3. **Evaluate**: What are the trade-offs? (Impact vs. Effort, Short vs. Long term)
4. **Decide**: Choose and commit
5. **Learn**: Review outcomes to improve future decisions

## Pro Tips
- For complex decisions: Write down your reasoning
- For urgent decisions: Use \"good enough\" criteria
- For team decisions: Seek diverse perspectives, then decide
- For reversible decisions: Decide faster
- For irreversible decisions: Decide slower
