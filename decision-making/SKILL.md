## Overview
Decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action from multiple alternatives. It involves gathering information, evaluating options, and committing to a choice, often under conditions of uncertainty or competing priorities.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Types of Decisions**
   - **Programmed Decisions**: Routine, repetitive decisions governed by established rules or procedures.
   - **Non-programmed Decisions**: Unique, complex decisions requiring novel solutions and judgment.

### 2. **Decision-Making Models**
   - **Rational Model**: Logical, step-by-step approach assuming complete information and optimal outcomes.
   - **Bounded Rationality**: Recognizes cognitive limits; seeks satisfactory rather than optimal solutions.
   - **Intuitive Model**: Relies on experience, instincts, and pattern recognition.
   - **Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD)**: Experts quickly match situations to known patterns to determine actions.
