# SKILL: Design Thinking

## What It Is
A human-centered problem-solving framework that prioritizes empathy, creativity, and iterative prototyping to develop innovative solutions.

## Core Phases (Double Diamond Model)
1. **Discover** â Research and understand user needs and context.
2. **Define** â Synthesize insights to frame the core problem.
3. **Develop** â Brainstorm and generate a wide range of potential solutions.
4. **Deliver** â Build prototypes, test with users, and refine the solution.

## Key Principles
- **Human-Centered:** Start and end with the user.
- **Collaborative:** Cross-disciplinary teamwork is essential.
- **Bias Toward Action:** Build to think; learn by making.
- **Embrace Ambiguity:** Be comfortable with "not knowing" early on.
- **Iterative:** Test, learn, and refine continuously.

## When to Use It
- Solving complex, ambiguous problems.
