## What It Is
A human-centered problem-solving framework that prioritizes empathy, creativity, and iterative prototyping to develop innovative solutions.

## Core Phases (Double Diamond Model)
1. **Discover** – Research and understand user needs and context.
2. **Define** – Synthesize insights to frame the core problem.
3. **Develop** – Brainstorm and generate a wide range of potential solutions.
4. **Deliver** – Build prototypes, test with users, and refine the solution.

## Key Principles
- **Human-Centered:** Start and end with the user.
- **Collaborative:** Involve cross-disciplinary teams.
- **Bias Toward Action:** Learn by making and testing.
- **Embrace Ambiguity:** Be comfortable with \"not knowing\" early on.
- **Iterative:** Treat solutions as hypotheses to be refined.

## When to Use It
- Solving complex, ambiguous problems.
