## What It Is
A human-centered problem-solving framework that prioritizes empathy, creativity, and iterative prototyping to develop innovative solutions.

## Core Phases (The Double Diamond)

1. **Discover** – Understand the problem through user research and empathy.
2. **Define** – Synthesize insights to frame the core challenge.
3. **Develop** – Brainstorm and generate a wide range of possible solutions.
4. **Deliver** – Build prototypes, test with users, and refine.

## Key Principles
- **Human-Centered:** Start and end with the user’s needs.
- **Bias Toward Action:** Build to think; make ideas tangible quickly.
- **Embrace Iteration:** Treat everything as a prototype; learn from failure.
- **Collaborative:** Involve diverse perspectives and co-create.
