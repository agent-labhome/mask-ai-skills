## Overview
Time management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control over time spent on specific activities to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity. It involves balancing various demands of work, social life, family, hobbies, and personal interests within the finite limits of time.

## Core Principles

### 1. **The Eisenhower Matrix**
A prioritization framework that divides tasks into four quadrants:
- **Urgent & Important** (Do immediately)
- **Important but Not Urgent** (Schedule for later)
- **Urgent but Not Important** (Delegate if possible)
- **Not Urgent & Not Important** (Eliminate)

### 2. **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**
80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Identify and focus on high-impact activities.

### 3. **Parkinson's Law**
Work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Set artificial deadlines to create healthy pressure.

### 4. **Time Blocking**
Schedule specific blocks of time for different activities or tasks, treating time as a finite resource to be allocated.
