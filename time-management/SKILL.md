## Core Principles
- **Prioritization:** Distinguish urgent vs. important tasks (Eisenhower Matrix).
- **Planning:** Allocate time intentionally via daily/weekly scheduling.
- **Focus:** Minimize distractions and context-switching (e.g., time blocking).
- **Boundaries:** Learn to say \"no\" and protect deep work time.

## Key Techniques
- **Time Blocking:** Assign specific blocks for tasks, meetings, and breaks.
- **The 2-Minute Rule:** If it takes <2 minutes, do it immediately.
- **Pomodoro Technique:** Work in focused 25-minute sprints with short breaks.
- **Batching:** Group similar tasks (e.g., emails, calls) to preserve mental flow.

Maximizes productive output, reduces stress, and ensures progress toward key goals."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":180,"total_tokens":196,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
