## Core Objective
Effectively prioritize, allocate, and protect time to maximize productivity, reduce stress, and achieve key goals.

## Key Principles

1.  **Clarity Before Action:** Define what \"important\" means. Align tasks with overarching goals.
2.  **Intentional Planning:** Proactively design your time. A plan is a defense against the urgent but unimportant.
3.  **Focus is a Force Multiplier:** Dedicated, uninterrupted work beats fragmented effort. Protect your attention.
4.  **Energy Over Hours:** Schedule demanding tasks for peak energy periods. Manage stamina, not just minutes.
5.  **Ruthless Prioritization:** Learn to say \"no\" or \"not now.\" Doing fewer things better is the path to greater impact.

## Essential Techniques & Frameworks
