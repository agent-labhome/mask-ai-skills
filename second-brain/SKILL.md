## Overview
A Second Brain is an external, organized system for capturing, organizing, and retrieving knowledge, ideas, and insights. Unlike biological memory, it's designed for long-term storage and creative connection-making, freeing mental space for higher-order thinking.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Capture Everything**
- Record ideas, quotes, insights, and resources immediately
- Use low-friction tools (quick notes, voice memos, bookmarking)
- Follow the rule: \"If it resonates, capture it\"

### 2. **Organize for Action**
- Structure information by projects, not topics
- Use the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Organize for retrieval, not just storage

### 3. **Connect Ideas**
- Create links between related notes
- Look for patterns and relationships
- Use tags sparingly and consistently

### 4. **Create Consistently**
- Regularly review and synthesize notes
- Transform captured information into original work
- Share insights to reinforce learning
