## Overview
Financial planning is the process of managing your financial resources to achieve life goals through proper management of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. It's less about mathematical genius and more about consistent habits, informed decision-making, and behavioral discipline.

## Core Principles

### 1. **The Planning Mindset**
- **Future-oriented thinking**: Every financial decision today impacts tomorrow
- **Holistic approach**: Money connects to health, relationships, and life goals
- **Adaptability**: Plans must evolve with life changes and economic conditions
- **Risk awareness**: Understanding what can go wrong and preparing accordingly

### 2. **Fundamental Frameworks**
- **Pay Yourself First**: Automate savings before spending
- **Emergency Fund**: 3-6 months of expenses in liquid accounts
- **Debt Management**: Prioritize high-interest debt elimination
- **Diversification**: Don't concentrate risk in single assets or accounts
- **Time Value of Money**: Money today is worth more than money tomorrow
