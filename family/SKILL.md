## Purpose
A concise, structured way to capture essential family information for personal records, emergency planning, or sharing with caregivers.

## Structure
Each entry follows this format:

**[Relation]: [Full Name]**
- **Contact:** [Phone/Email]
- **Notes:** [Key details: e.g., \"Emergency contact,\" \"Allergies: penicillin,\" \"School: Lincoln Elementary\"]

## Rules
1.  **One family member per entry.**
2.  **Start with the relation** (e.g., Spouse, Child, Parent, Sibling).
3.  **Use bold for labels** (Relation, Contact, Notes).
4.  **Keep notes brief and factual.** Focus on critical info.
5.  **List entries in order of immediate household first, then extended family.**

## Example
**Spouse: Jamie Smith**
- **Contact:** 555-1234, j.smith@email.com
- **Notes:**"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
