## Overview
Visual Effects (VFX) is the process of creating, manipulating, or enhancing imagery for film, television, games, and other media outside of live-action shooting. It combines artistry with technical problem-solving to create believable illusions that serve storytelling.

## Core Competencies

### 1. **Compositing**
- **Definition:** Combining visual elements from separate sources into single, coherent images
- **Key Software:** Nuke, After Effects, Fusion
- **Essential Techniques:**
  - Multi-pass rendering and compositing
  - Green/blue screen keying (chroma key)
  - Color grading and matching
  - Rotoscoping and matte creation
  - Camera tracking integration
  - Depth-based compositing (Z-depth passes)

### 2. **3D Modeling & Texturing**
- **Definition:** Creating digital assets and surfaces
- **Key Software:** Maya, Blender, ZBrush, Substance Painter
- **Essential Techniques:**
  - Hard-surface and organic modeling
  - UV unwrapping and texture mapping
  - PBR (Physically Based Rendering) workflow
  - Displacement and normal mapping
  - Look development (lookdev)

### 3. **Simulation & Dynamics**
- **Definition:** Creating realistic physical behaviors through computation
- **Key Software:** Houdini, Maya Bifrost, EmberGen
- **Essential Techniques:**
  - Fluid simulations (water, smoke, fire)
  - Particle systems
  - Rigid body dynamics (destruction)
  - Cloth and hair simulation
  - Procedural generation

### 4. **Lighting & Rendering**
- **Definition:** Illuminating scenes and generating final images
- **Key Software:** Arnold, Redshift, V-Ray, RenderMan
- **Essential Techniques:**
  - Three-point lighting and cinematic lighting
  - Global illumination and HDRI lighting
