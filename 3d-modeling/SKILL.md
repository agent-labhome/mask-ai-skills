## Overview
3D modeling is the process of creating a three-dimensional digital representation of any surface or object using specialized software. It is a foundational skill for industries including video games, film, animation, architecture, product design, and VR/AR.

## Core Concepts & Terminology

### 1. Modeling Types
- **Polygonal Modeling:** Building objects using polygons (quads, tris). The industry standard for real-time applications (games).
- **NURBS/Spline Modeling:** Using mathematically defined curves and surfaces. Common in industrial and automotive design for high-precision surfaces.
- **Digital Sculpting:** Mimicking traditional clay sculpting. Used for high-detail organic models (characters, creatures).
- **Procedural Modeling:** Creating models using algorithms and rules (e.g., Houdini, geometry nodes in Blender).

### 2. Essential Geometry
- **Vertex:** A single point in 3D space.
- **Edge:** A line connecting two vertices.
- **Face/Polygon:** A flat surface enclosed by edges (triangles or quadrilaterals).
- **Mesh:** The entire collection of vertices, edges, and faces that make up an object.
- **Topology:** The flow and arrangement of polygons on a mesh. Good topology is crucial for animation and subdivision.

### 3. Core Techniques
- **Extrusion:** Pulling a face or edge out to create new geometry.
- **Loop Cuts & Slide:** Adding and positioning edge loops to control subdivision and detail.
- **Bevel:** Rounding off edges for realism.
- **Boolean Operations:** Combining or cutting shapes using addition,"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":20,"completion_tokens":450,"total_tokens":470,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":20},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
