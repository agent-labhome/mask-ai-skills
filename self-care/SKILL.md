## Purpose
A concise, practical guide to essential self-care practices that support mental, emotional, and physical well-being.

## Core Principles
1. **Consistency Over Intensity:** Small, regular actions are more sustainable than grand, occasional efforts.
2. **Holistic Approach:** Address mind, body, and environment.
3. **Personalization:** Adapt practices to fit your unique needs and lifestyle.

## Essential Practices

### 1. Foundational (Non-Negotiable)
- **Sleep:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep. Maintain a consistent schedule.
- **Hydration:** Drink water throughout the day. Start with a glass upon waking.
- **Nutrition:** Eat regular, balanced meals. Don't skip breakfast.

### 2. Mental & Emotional
- **Daily Pause:** Take 5 minutes of quiet time—no screens, no tasks.
- **Boundaries:** Learn to say \"no\" to protect your time"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
