## Purpose
A concise, actionable guide to maintaining mental, emotional, and physical well-being through simple, sustainable practices.

## Core Principles
1. **Consistency Over Intensity**: Small, daily actions > occasional grand gestures.
2. **Listen to Your Needs**: Self-care is personal—what works for one may not work for another.
3. **Non-Negotiable, Not Selfish**: It's essential maintenance, not a luxury.

## Quick Actions (Under 5 Minutes)
- **Breathe**: Take 3 deep, intentional breaths.
- **Hydrate**: Drink a full glass of water.
- **Stretch**: Stand up and reach for the ceiling.
- **Declutter**: Clear one small surface.
- **Gratitude**: Name one thing you appreciate right now.

## Daily Foundations
- **Sleep**: Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality rest.
- **Nourishment**: Eat something nutritious.
