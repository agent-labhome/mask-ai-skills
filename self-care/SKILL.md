**What it is:** The intentional practice of maintaining your physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

**Why it matters:** It's not selfish; it's essential. You cannot pour from an empty cup. Consistent self-care builds resilience, prevents burnout, and enables you to show up fully in all areas of life.

**Core Practices:**

*   **Physical:** Prioritize sleep, move your body, nourish yourself with good food.
*   **Mental:** Set boundaries, take breaks, engage in hobbies, learn to say no.
*   **Emotional:** Name your feelings, practice self-compassion, connect with supportive people.
*   **Practical:** Manage your time, declutter your space, handle necessary tasks to reduce background stress.

**Quick Start:** Schedule a non-negotiable 15-minute block today for one thing that recharges you. Protect it like an important meeting."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":188,"total_tokens":204,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
