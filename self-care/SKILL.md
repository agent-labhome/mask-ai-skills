## Core Principle
Self-care is the intentional practice of maintaining your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It is not selfish; it is essential for sustainable performance and resilience.

## Key Practices

**Physical**
- Prioritize sleep (7-9 hours)
- Move your body daily
- Eat to nourish, not just to fill
- Hydrate consistently

**Mental**
- Set and protect boundaries (work/life, digital)
- Schedule regular breaks
- Practice saying \"no\" without guilt
- Engage in activities that bring joy

**Emotional**
- Check in with yourself daily
- Allow yourself to feel without judgment
- Seek connection or solitude as needed
- Acknowledge small wins
