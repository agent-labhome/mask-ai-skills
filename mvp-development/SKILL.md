## Core Principle
Build the simplest version that validates your core hypothesis with real users.

## Key Steps
1. **Define Core Hypothesis**
   - What problem are you solving?
   - Who has this problem?
   - What's your proposed solution?

2. **Identify Essential Features**
   - What's the absolute minimum needed to test your hypothesis?
   - Remove everything else

3. **Build Fast, Learn Fast**
   - Use existing tools when possible
   - Prioritize learning over perfection
   - Set clear success metrics

4. **Test & Iterate**
   - Get it in front of real users quickly
   - Measure against your metrics
   - Pivot or persevere based on data
