## Skill Description
MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Development is the practice of building the simplest version of a product that delivers core value to early adopters while minimizing development time and resources. It's a strategic approach to validate assumptions, gather feedback, and iterate before committing to full-scale development.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Minimum ≠ Mediocre**
- Focus on solving one core problem exceptionally well
- Eliminate all non-essential features
- Quality of core experience must remain high

### 2. **Value First**
- Identify the single most important value proposition
- Every element must contribute to validating core assumptions
- Remove anything that doesn't directly support learning objectives

### 3. **Build-Measure-Learn Loop**
- Rapid iteration cycles (1-4 weeks typical)
- Clear success metrics defined upfront
- Decisions driven by data, not opinions

## Practical Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Validation (1-2 weeks)
```
1. Define Target User & Problem
   - Create user persona (1-2 primary types)
   - Document problem statement with evidence
   - Validate through 5-10 user interviews

2. Identify Riskiest Assumptions
   - List all assumptions about users, market, solution
   - Rank by risk (what would kill the product if wrong?)
   - Focus validation on top 3 riskiest assumptions

3. Define Success Metrics
