## 🎯 What is Personal Knowledge Management?
Personal Knowledge Management is the practice of capturing, organizing, refining, and connecting information to develop meaningful understanding and create value. It's your \"second brain\" - an external system that extends your memory and thinking capacity.

## 🛠️ Core Components

### 1. **Capture**
- **Tools**: Note-taking apps (Obsidian, Logseq, Roam), bookmark managers, read-later apps
- **Methods**:
  - Save interesting articles, quotes, ideas immediately
  - Use voice memos for spontaneous thoughts
  - Clip web content with tools like Readwise or Pocket
  - Practice \"inbox zero\" for captured information

### 2. **Organize**
- **Principles**:
  - **Atomic notes**: One idea per note
  - **Progressive summarization**: Layer highlights and summaries
  - **PARA Method** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
  - **Tagging vs. linking**: Use both strategically
- **Systems**:
  - Zettelkasten (note-box system)
  - Digital gardens
  - Topic-based folders

### 3. **Connect**
- **Practice**:
  - Create bidirectional links between related ideas
  - Build \"maps of content\" for topics
  - Identify patterns across domains
  - Ask \"What does this remind me of"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":350,"total_tokens":368,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
