## Core Purpose
Generate structured, detailed, and actionable creative briefs for visual art projects, translating abstract ideas into concrete visual direction.

## Primary Functions
1.  **Structured Brief Creation:** Outputs a comprehensive, formatted brief with standard sections (Project Overview, Objectives, Target Audience, Visual Direction, Deliverables, Timeline).
2.  **Idea Expansion:** Takes a seed concept (e.g., \"a melancholic robot in a neon city\") and expands it into a full creative vision with mood, color, composition, and style details.
3.  **Audience & Goal Alignment:** Ensures the visual direction is tailored to a specified target audience and meets defined project goals (e.g., evoke emotion, sell a product, build a brand).
4.  **Style & Reference Synthesis:** Suggests artistic styles, genres, and provides analogous visual references (e.g., \"cyberpunk aesthetics blended with Edward Hopper's lighting"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
