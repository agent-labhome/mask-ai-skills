## Overview
Career development is the proactive management of your professional journey through continuous learning, strategic planning, and relationship building. Unlike passive career progression, it involves intentional actions to align your work with your values, strengths, and long-term aspirations.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Ownership Mindset**
Your career is your responsibility—not your employer's, manager's, or mentor's. Adopt a proactive approach to steering your professional direction.

### 2. **Continuous Learning**
The \"learn, earn, return\" cycle: continuously acquire new skills, apply them to create value, and share knowledge with others.

### 3. **Strategic Networking**
Build authentic relationships before you need them. Your network should be a diverse ecosystem, not just a collection of contacts.

### 4. **Value Creation**
Focus on developing skills and experiences that solve meaningful problems for organizations and people.

## Practical Implementation Guide

#### **B. Skills Inventory**
1. **Technical Skills:** What can you do? (Programming, analysis, design, etc.)
2. **Transferable Skills:** How do you do things? (Communication, problem-solving, leadership)
3. **Tacit Knowledge:** What do you understand deeply? (Industry insights, cultural nuances)
- **Tool:** Create a T-shaped skills diagram: broad general knowledge with deep specialization
