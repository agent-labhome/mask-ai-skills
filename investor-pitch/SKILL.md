## Purpose
Quickly distill complex business ideas into a concise, compelling pitch that captures investor attention in 3-5 minutes.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity Over Completeness**: Focus on the essential story, not every detail
- **Problem-First**: Start with the pain point, then present your solution
- **Numbers That Matter**: Use only the most impactful metrics
- **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Use simple analogies and concrete examples

## Essential Structure (3-5 Minutes)

### 1. Hook (30 seconds)
- Start with a surprising statistic, relatable scenario, or bold vision statement
- \"Did you know that [problem] costs businesses $X billion annually?\"

### 2. Problem (60 seconds)
- Who experiences this pain? How often? At what cost?
- Make it specific and quantifiable
- \"Every day, [target customer] struggles with [specific pain point]\"
