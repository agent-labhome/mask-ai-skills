## Purpose
Create clear, concise hiring briefs that align stakeholders and attract the right candidates.

## Core Principles

**Clarity Over Completeness**
- Focus on essential requirements (must-haves vs. nice-to-haves)
- Define the problem the hire will solve, not just the job title
- Specify 3-5 key outcomes for first 6-12 months

**Alignment First**
- Identify key stakeholders (hiring manager, team, cross-functional partners)
- Document decision criteria and evaluation process upfront
- Agree on budget range and constraints before posting

**Candidate-Centric**
- Write for the candidate's perspective
- Highlight growth opportunities and impact
- Use inclusive language that welcomes diverse backgrounds
