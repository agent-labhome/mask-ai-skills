## What is Print on Demand?
Print on Demand (POD) is a business model where you design custom products (like t-shirts, mugs, posters) that are only manufactured **after** a customer places an order. You handle design, marketing, and customer service, while a third-party supplier handles printing, packaging, and shipping. No inventory, no upfront costs.

## Core Principles
1.  **No Inventory Risk:** The cardinal rule. You never buy stock upfront.
2.  **Design is King:** Success is 80% about finding winning designs/niches and 20% about execution.
3.  **It's a Marketing Business:** You are not a printer. You are a marketer who sells printed products.
4.  **Test & Scale:** Launch many designs, double down on what works"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":21,"completion_tokens":250,"total_tokens":271,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":21},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
