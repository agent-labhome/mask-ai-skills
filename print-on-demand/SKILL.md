## Overview

Print on Demand is a fulfillment method where a business does not keep products in stock. Instead, items are printed, packaged, and shipped by a third-party supplier only after a customer places an order. This model eliminates inventory risk, upfront costs, and logistical complexity, allowing creators and entrepreneurs to focus on design, marketing, and customer service.

## Core Principles

1.  **Asset-Light Business Model:** No need to purchase inventory upfront. You only pay for a product when it's sold.
2.  **Design-Centric Value:** The primary value you provide is unique, high-quality design and niche targeting.
3.  **Automated Fulfillment:** Integration between your store and the POD supplier automates the order process from sale to delivery.
4.  **Scalability:** The model can scale efficiently without proportional increases in personal workload or capital investment.
