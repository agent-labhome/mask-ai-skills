## Purpose
Quickly create clear, actionable UI briefs that align stakeholders and guide design execution.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity over creativity** - Be specific, not poetic
- **User-centered** - Start with user needs and goals
- **Actionable** - Provide enough detail for execution
- **Concise** - One page maximum

## Essential Components

### 1. Project Context
- **Problem Statement**: What user problem are we solving?
- **Business Goal**: What business outcome does this support?
- **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success?

### 2. User Perspective
- **Primary User**: Who is this for? (1-2 sentences)
- **User Goal**: What does the user want to accomplish?
- **Current Pain Points**: What frustrations exist now?

### 3. Requirements
- **Must Have**: Non-negotiable features/functions
