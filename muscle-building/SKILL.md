# SKILL: Muscle Building

## Core Principles
- **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase weight, reps, or intensity over time.
- **Protein Priority**: Consume 0.7â1g of protein per pound of bodyweight daily.
- **Recovery Focus**: Muscles grow during rest, not workouts. Prioritize sleep (7â9 hours) and manage stress.

## Key Methods
- **Compound Lifts**: Base your training on squats, deadlifts, presses, and rows.
- **Rep Ranges**: Train primarily in the 6â12 rep range for hypertrophy.
- **Consistency**: Adhere to a structured program for 8+ weeks before changing.

## Quick Tips
- Track your workouts and nutrition.
- Stay in a slight calorie surplus (200â500 calories above maintenance).
- Hydrate well and time protein intake around workouts."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":182,"total_tokens":198,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache
