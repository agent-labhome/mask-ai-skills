## Purpose
A concise, structured document that captures the essential elements of an integration project to align stakeholders, define scope, and establish clear requirements before development begins.

## Core Components

### 1. Project Context & Objectives
- **Business Problem/Need**: Clear statement of what business challenge the integration solves
- **Goals & Success Metrics**: Specific, measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Reduce manual data entry by 80%\")
- **Stakeholders**: Key decision-makers, users, and technical contacts from all involved systems

### 2. Integration Scope
- **Systems Involved**: Source and destination systems with versions/APIs
- **Data Flow Direction**: Unidirectional (A→B) or bidirectional (A↔B)
- **In-Scope Items**: Specific data objects, fields, and operations to be integrated
- **Out-of-Scope Items**: Explicitly excluded elements to prevent scope creep
