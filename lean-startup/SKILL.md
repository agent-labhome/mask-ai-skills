## Practical Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Problem/Solution Fit
**Objective**: Validate that you're solving a real problem for real customers

**Key Activities**:
- **Customer Discovery**: Interview 20-30 potential customers
- **Problem Validation**: Document specific pain points, frequency, and current workarounds
- **Solution Sketching**: Create low-fidelity mockups or concierge prototypes
- **Value Proposition Testing**: Test if your proposed solution resonates

**Output**: Clear evidence that customers have the problem you're solving

### Phase 2: Build Your MVP
**Objective**: Create the smallest possible product to start the learning process

**MVP Types**:
- **Concierge MVP**: Manual service that mimics the eventual product
