## Overview
Team Building is the intentional process of strengthening relationships, improving collaboration, and enhancing collective performance within a group. It involves creating environments and experiences that foster trust, communication, and shared purpose.

## Core Principles

1. **Psychological Safety** - Creating an environment where team members feel safe to take risks, voice opinions, and admit mistakes without fear of negative consequences.

2. **Shared Purpose** - Aligning team members around common goals, values, and vision that transcend individual interests.

3. **Interdependence Awareness** - Helping team members understand how their work connects to and depends on others.

4. **Inclusive Participation** - Ensuring all voices are heard and valued, regardless of role, seniority, or personality type.

5. **Continuous Process** - Recognizing that team building is not a one-time event but an ongoing practice.
