**Core Principle:** Extract maximum value from minimal time investment.

**Method:**

1.  **Define the \"Why\":** Before starting, ask: \"What is the one key concept or actionable insight I need from this?\" Write it down.
2.  **Time-Box the Input:** Allocate a strict, short window (e.g., 20 minutes). Use a timer.
3.  **Skim for Structure:** Scan headings, summaries, conclusions, and bold terms first. Map the core argument.
4.  **Targeted Deep Dive:** Focus *only* on sections directly relevant to your \"Why.\" Ignore the rest.
5.  **Forced Synthesis:** When the timer ends, write a one-sentence summary and one potential application. This is non-negotiable.

**Output:** A clear, concise takeaway and a next step, not just consumed information.

**Mantra:** \"Clarity over completeness"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
