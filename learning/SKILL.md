## Core Learning Philosophy
**Learning is not consumption; it's construction.**  
We don't "absorb" knowledgeâwe actively build mental models through focused engagement, deliberate practice, and iterative refinement.

## The Learning Brief Framework

### 1. **Define the Learning Objective**
- **What exactly** do you want to understand or be able to do?
- **Why** does this matter? (Connect to larger goals)
- **Success criteria:** How will you know you've learned it?

### 2. **Map the Territory**
- **Scope boundaries:** What's in/out of this learning sprint?
- **Prerequisite knowledge:** What must you already understand?
- **Key concepts:** 3-5 core ideas that form the foundation
- **Common misconceptions** to avoid

### 3. **Curate Learning Resources**
- **Primary source** (1-2 highest quality resources)
- **Alternative explanations** (different perspectives)
