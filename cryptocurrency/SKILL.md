## What is Cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat money), cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers (nodes).

## Key Characteristics

### 1. **Decentralization**
- No central authority (like a bank or government) controls the network
- Transactions are verified by network participants through consensus mechanisms

### 2. **Blockchain Technology**
- Immutable, transparent public ledger
- Transactions recorded in blocks that are cryptographically linked
- Distributed across multiple computers worldwide

### 3. **Cryptographic Security**
- Uses public-key cryptography for secure transactions
- Digital signatures verify authenticity
- Hash functions protect data integrity

## Major Types

### **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- First cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto
