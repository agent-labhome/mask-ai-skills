## What is Motion Graphics?

Motion graphics is the art of bringing graphic design elements to life through animation. Unlike character animation which focuses on storytelling through movement, motion graphics emphasizes visual communication through animated typography, shapes, icons, and data visualization.

## Core Principles

### 1. **The 12 Principles of Animation (Adapted)**
   - **Timing & Spacing**: Controls the speed and rhythm of movements
   - **Easing**: Natural acceleration/deceleration (ease in/out)
   - **Anticipation**: Preparing the viewer for an action
   - **Follow-through**: Elements continue moving after main action stops
   - **Arcs**: Natural curved paths rather than straight lines
   - **Squash & Stretch**: Adding weight and flexibility

### 2. **Design Fundamentals in Motion**
   - **Hierarchy**: What moves first, what follows, what's emphasized
   - **Contrast**: Size, speed, direction, and timing variations
   - **Repetition & Rhythm**: Creating visual patterns through motion
   - **Negative Space**: Using empty areas as active design elements

## Technical Skills Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
**Essential Software: Adobe After Effects**
- Interface navigation and workspace setup
- Basic keyframing: Position, Scale, Rotation, Opacity
- Understanding the timeline and graph editor
- Working with shape layers and masks
- Basic text animation
- Export settings and codecs

**Practical Exercise**: Create a 10-second animated logo with accompanying typography

### Phase 2: Core Techniques (Months 4-6)
**Advanced Animation**
- Mastering the graph editor for custom easing
- Parenting and null objects for complex hierarchies
- Trim paths and stroke animation
- Track mattes and blending modes
- Basic expressions (wiggle, loop, time)
