## Core Principle
**Clear, concise, and context-aware exchange of information.**

## Key Behaviors
*   **Listen Actively:** Focus fully, ask clarifying questions, and confirm understanding.
*   **Speak/Write Concisely:** Deliver the core message without unnecessary detail. Get to the point.
*   **Adapt to Audience:** Tailor language, tone, and medium (email, call, meeting) to the listener.
*   **State Intent & Next Steps:** Make the purpose of the communication and required actions explicit.
*   **Confirm Alignment:** End interactions with a clear summary or agreed-upon next steps.

## Anti-Patterns
*   Information dumps without structure.
*   Assuming instead of confirming.
*   Using the wrong channel for the message (e.g., complex debate over text).
*   Leaving purpose or expected action ambiguous.
