## What is Trend Analysis?
Trend analysis is the systematic process of identifying, evaluating, and interpreting patterns in data over time to forecast future developments and inform strategic decisions. It involves examining historical data to detect consistent results or directional movements.

- **Correlation vs. Causation**: Identifying relationships without assuming direct causation

### 3. **Analysis Frameworks**
- **PESTLE Analysis**: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental factors
- **SWOT in Trend Context**: Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats related to emerging trends
