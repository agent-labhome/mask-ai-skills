## Overview
Shopify dropshipping is a business model where you sell products through a Shopify store without holding inventory. When a customer places an order, you purchase the item from a third-party supplier (typically AliExpress) who ships it directly to the customer. You earn the difference between the retail price and wholesale cost.
