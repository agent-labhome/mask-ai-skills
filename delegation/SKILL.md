## What is Delegation?
Delegation is the process of assigning responsibility and authority to others to complete specific tasks or make certain decisions. It's not just about offloading work—it's about empowering team members while freeing up your own time for higher-level responsibilities.

## Why Delegate?
- **Efficiency**: Leverage others' skills and time
- **Development**: Grow team members' capabilities
- **Scalability**: Enable you to focus on strategic work
- **Succession**: Build future leaders

✅ **Good candidates:**
- Routine tasks you've mastered
- Tasks others can do better/faster
- Development opportunities for team members
- Time-consuming but not mission-critical work

❌ **Generally keep:**
- Performance reviews
- Confidential matters
- Crisis management
- Core strategic decisions
