## Core Principle
Negotiation is a collaborative process to reach mutually beneficial agreements, not a battle to be won.

## Key Framework: BATNA
**Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement**
- Know your walk-away point before you start.
- Estimate the other party's BATNA to gauge their flexibility.
- Your power increases as your BATNA improves.

## Essential Tactics
1.  **Prepare Thoroughly:** Research interests, constraints, and goals (yours and theirs).
2.  **Anchor First (when possible):** Set the initial offer ambitiously but reasonably to frame the discussion.
3.  **Separate People from Problem:** Be hard on the issue, soft on the person. Use \"we\" to frame as a shared challenge.
4.  **Focus on Interests, Not Positions:** Ask \"why\" to uncover underlying needs. Explore options before deciding.
5.  **Practice Active Listening:** Paraphrase"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":216,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
