## Overview
Negotiation is a strategic discussion between two or more parties aimed at reaching an agreement that satisfies all involved. It's not about \"winning\" but about finding mutually beneficial solutions while preserving relationships.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Preparation is Non-Negotiable**
- Research all parties involved
- Define your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)
- Determine your ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)
- Identify your must-haves, nice-to-haves, and tradeables
- Anticipate the other party's interests and constraints

### 2. **Separate People from Problems**
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Address emotions without being controlled by them
- Build rapport while maintaining professional boundaries
- Use \"we\" language to frame as collaborative problem-solving

### 3. **Create Value Before Claiming It**
- Explore options that expand the pie before dividing it
- Look for differences in priorities that enable trades
- Ask \"What would make this work for you?\" questions
- Package multiple issues together for creative solutions"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":300,"total_tokens":318,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
