## Purpose
A structured framework for creating clear, actionable project briefs that align client needs with freelancer capabilities, ensuring successful project outcomes.

## Core Principles

**Clarity Over Assumptions**
- Every detail matters; ambiguity leads to scope creep
- Document everything, even what seems obvious
- Define terms specific to the project context

**Mutual Understanding**
- Briefs are collaborative tools, not one-way directives
- Both client and freelancer should contribute to the brief
- Shared vocabulary prevents misinterpretation

**Actionable Specificity**
- Vague goals become specific, measurable deliverables
- Every requirement should be executable without guesswork
- Include concrete examples and references where possible

## The Brief Framework

### 1. Project Foundation
