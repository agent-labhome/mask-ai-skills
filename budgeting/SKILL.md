## What is Budgeting?
Budgeting is the process of creating a plan for how you'll spend your money. It ensures you have enough for necessities while making intentional choices about discretionary spending, savings, and debt repayment.

## Why Budget?
- **Control**: Direct your money instead of wondering where it went
- **Goals**: Systematically save for vacations, emergencies, or major purchases
- **Reduced Stress**: Eliminate financial surprises
- **Debt Management**: Create a plan to pay down debt efficiently
- **Financial Awareness**: Understand your spending patterns and priorities

## Core Principles

### 1. The 50/30/20 Rule (Simplified Framework)
- **50% Needs**: Housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, minimum debt payments
- **30% Wants**: Dining out, entertainment, hobbies, subscriptions
- **20% Savings/Debt**: Emergency fund, retirement, extra debt payments

### 2. Zero-Based Budgeting
Every dollar has a job. Income minus expenses equals zero (with \"expenses\" including savings).

### 3. Pay Yourself First
Automate savings before you have a chance to spend.
