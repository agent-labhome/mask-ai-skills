## Metadata
- **Type**: Qualitative Research Method
- **Time Required**: 30-60 minutes per interview
- **Participants**: 1 interviewer, 1 participant
- **Best For**: Understanding user needs, motivations, behaviors, and pain points
- **Output**: Insights, quotes, patterns, opportunities for improvement
- **Tools**: Recording device, note-taking tool, interview guide, consent forms

## Overview
User interviews are structured conversations with target users to understand their experiences, needs, and perspectives. Unlike surveys, interviews allow for deeper exploration through follow-up questions and observation of non-verbal cues.

## Preparation Phase

### 1. Define Objectives
- What do you need to learn?
- What decisions will this research inform?
- What assumptions need validation?

### 2. Recruit Participants
- **Target**: 5-8 representative users (saturation typically occurs here)
- **Screening**: Use criteria relevant to your research questions
- **Incentives**: Offer appropriate compensation (gift cards, product credits)

### 3. Create Interview Guide
Structure your guide with:
- **Introduction** (5 min): Build rapport, explain purpose, obtain consent
- **Warm-up** (5 min): Easy, non-threatening questions
- **Main Questions** (30-40 min): Core topics, open-ended questions
- **Cool-down** (5 min): Light questions, allow participant to add anything
- **Conclusion** (5 min): Thank participant, explain next steps

### 4. Logistics
- Schedule 60-minute slots (45 interview + 15 buffer)
- Test recording equipment
- Prepare quiet, comfortable space (physical or virtual)
- Have backup plan for technical issues

## During the Interview
