## Overview
Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network without central authority, using blockchain technology to record transactions.

## Key Concepts
- **Blockchain**: Public, distributed ledger of all transactions
- **Proof-of-Work**: Consensus mechanism requiring computational effort
- **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the network
- **Limited Supply**: Capped at 21 million BTC
- **Mining**: Process of validating transactions and creating new blocks

## Primary Use Cases
1. Digital store of value (\"digital gold\")
2. Peer-to-peer electronic cash system
3. Hedge against inflation/fiat currency devaluation
4. Settlement layer for financial transactions

## Technical Details
- **Symbol**: BTC, XBT
- **Block Time**: ~10 minutes
- **Block Reward**: Halves approximately every 4 years (current: 3."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
