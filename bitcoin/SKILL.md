## Overview
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates without a central authority or intermediaries, using a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic proof to validate transactions.

## Key Features
- **Decentralization**: No central bank or single administrator controls the network.
- **Limited Supply**: Capped at 21 million coins, creating scarcity.
- **Blockchain Technology**: Public, distributed ledger recording all transactions.
- **Proof-of-Work**: Consensus mechanism requiring computational work to validate transactions and secure the network.
- **Pseudonymity**: Transactions are public but linked to cryptographic addresses, not directly to identities.

## Primary Use Cases
1. **Digital Store of Value**: Often called \"digital gold\" due to its scarcity and durability.
2. **Peer-to-Peer Payments**: Enables direct transfers without intermediaries.
3. **Inflation Hedge**: Perceived protection against currency devaluation.
