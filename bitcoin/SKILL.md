## Overview
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates without a central authority or intermediaries. It was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto and launched in January 2009.

## Core Concepts
- **Blockchain**: Public, distributed ledger recording all transactions
- **Decentralization**: No central controlling entity; maintained by a peer-to-peer network
- **Proof-of-Work**: Consensus mechanism requiring computational work to validate transactions
- **Limited Supply**: Capped at 21 million coins, creating scarcity
- **Pseudonymity**: Transactions are public but identities are encrypted

## Key Features
- Permissionless access and use
- Borderless transactions
- Censorship resistance
- Transparency of all transactions
- Immutable transaction history
