## Overview
A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a controlled experiment methodology used to compare two or more versions of a product feature, marketing campaign, or user experience to determine which performs better against a predefined metric. It's a fundamental tool for data-driven decision making in tech companies, marketing, and product development.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Experimental Design**
- **Hypothesis formulation**: Clear statement of what you're testing and expected outcome
- **Control vs. Treatment**: Baseline (A) vs. new version (B)
- **Randomization**: Random assignment of users to groups to avoid selection bias
- **Sample size calculation**: Determining how many participants needed for statistical power
- **Duration planning**: How long to run the experiment

### 2. **Key Metrics**
- **Primary metric**: The main success measure (e.g., conversion rate, revenue per user)
- **Guardrail metrics**: Measures to ensure no unintended negative consequences
- **Statistical significance**: Probability that observed difference isn't due to random chance
- **Practical significance**: Whether the observed difference matters in real-world terms

### 3. **Statistical Foundations**
- **Null hypothesis (H₀)**: No difference between groups
- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)**: There is a difference
- **P-value**: Probability of observing results if null hypothesis is true
- **Confidence intervals**: Range of plausible values for the true effect
- **Statistical power**: Probability of detecting an effect if it exists
- **Multiple testing correction**: Adjusting for testing multiple hypotheses
