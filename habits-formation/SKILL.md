## Core Principle
Habits form through consistent repetition in a specific context, creating automatic behaviors.

## Key Process (Habit Loop)
1. **Cue** - Trigger that initiates the behavior
2. **Routine** - The behavior itself
3. **Reward** - Benefit that reinforces the habit

## Effective Strategies
- **Start small** - Begin with 2-minute versions of habits
- **Stack habits** - Anchor new habits to existing routines
- **Design environment** - Make cues obvious and distractions invisible
- **Track consistency** - Use calendars or apps to maintain streaks
- **Focus on identity** - \"I am someone who...\" rather than \"I need to...\"

## Common Pitfalls
- Trying to change too much at once
- Not having a clear cue
- Missing rewards for completion
- Being too rigid with routines

## Maintenance
- Expect occasional failures (don't break the chain twice)
