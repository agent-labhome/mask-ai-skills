## Practical Applications

### 1. Inventory Management
**What it is**: Balancing stock levels to meet demand without overstocking
**How to practice**:
- Calculate key metrics: 
  - **Inventory Turnover** = Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory
  - **Days Inventory Outstanding** = (Average Inventory ÷ COGS) × 365
- Use ABC analysis: Categorize items by value (A = high value, C = low)
- Practice with spreadsheet simulations of stock levels vs. demand

### 2. Demand Forecasting
**What it is**: Predicting future customer demand
**How to practice**:
- Start with historical sales data (use dummy data if needed)
- Apply simple forecasting methods:
  - **Moving average**: Average of last 3-6 months
  - **Exponential smoothing**: Weighted average favoring recent data
- Track forecast accuracy: (Actual - Forecast) ÷ Actual × 100

### 3. Supplier Relationship Management
**What it is**: Developing strategic partnerships with suppliers
**How to practice**:
- Create a supplier scorecard with criteria:
  - Quality metrics (defect rates)
  - Delivery performance (on-time %)
  - Cost competitiveness
  - Responsiveness
- Practice negotiation scenarios using the BATNA framework (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)

### 4. Logistics Optimization
**What it is**: Efficient movement of goods
**How to practice**:
- Map a simple supply chain from supplier to customer
- Calculate total landed cost: Product cost + shipping + duties + insurance + handling
- Compare transportation modes (air vs. sea vs. ground) using cost/time tradeoffs

### 5. Risk Management
