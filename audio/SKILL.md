## Purpose
Create clear, concise audio production briefs that align creative vision with technical execution.

- Define primary objective (brand awareness, conversion, emotional connection)
- Specify target audience with psychographic details
- Identify key message hierarchy

### 2. **Creative Direction**
- Establish tone (urgent, warm, playful, authoritative)
- Reference existing audio assets or competitors
- Define vocal style (age, gender, energy level, accent)
- Specify music genre or mood requirements
- Include sonic branding elements if applicable

### 3. **Technical Specifications**
- Duration (exact or range)
- File format requirements
- Delivery specifications
- Technical constraints (broadcast standards, platform limitations)
