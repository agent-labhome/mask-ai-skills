## Purpose
A structured method for creating clear, actionable briefs that align teams, define scope, and establish measurable outcomes for any project or initiative.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity Over Completeness** - Better to have a clear, concise brief than an exhaustive but confusing one
2. **Outcome-Focused** - Define what success looks like, not just what to do
3. **Collaborative Foundation** - The brief serves as a shared reference point for all stakeholders
4. **Living Document** - Briefs should evolve as understanding deepens

## The Workflow Brief Framework

### 1. **Context & Why** (The Foundation)
- **Business Context**: What's happening in the market/organization?
- **Problem/Opportunity**: What are we solving or pursuing?
- **Strategic Alignment**: How does this connect to broader goals?
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Who cares about this and why"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
