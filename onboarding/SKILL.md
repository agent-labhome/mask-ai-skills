## Purpose
To create clear, structured, and effective onboarding briefs that accelerate new hire integration, align expectations, and set the foundation for long-term success.

## Core Principles

1.  **Clarity Over Completeness:** Prioritize essential, actionable information. Avoid overwhelming with minutiae.
2.  **Human-Centric:** Address the person, not just the role. Welcome them as an individual.
3.  **Future-Back:** Frame information around their success in the role and contribution to team/company goals.
4.  **Ownership & Warmth:** The brief should come from their manager/team, not just HR. It should feel personal and welcoming.

## Structure of an Effective Onboarding Brief

A great brief is a curated package, not a single document. Structure it in three parts:

### Part 1: The Welcome & The Why (Sent before Day 1)
