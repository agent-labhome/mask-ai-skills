# SKILL: User Generated Content (UGC)

## Purpose
Enable users to create, share, and interact with content within the platform.

## Core Actions
- **Create:** Users can generate text, images, audio, or video posts.
- **Share:** Users can publish their content to feeds, profiles, or groups.
- **Interact:** Users can like, comment on, and share others' content.
- **Curate:** Users can organize content (e.g., playlists, collections).

## Key Considerations
- **Moderation:** Implement systems to ensure content safety and policy compliance.
- **Attribution:** Clearly credit the original creator.
- **Incentives:** Consider gamification (badges, points) or recognition (featured content) to encourage participation.
- **Ownership:** Establish clear terms regarding user rights to their content.

## Best Practices
- Keep submission interfaces simple and intuitive.
- Foster a positive community with clear guidelines.
