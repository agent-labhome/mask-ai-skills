# Illustration Brief SKILL.md

## Overview
An illustration brief is a structured document that communicates creative requirements from a client to an illustrator. It serves as a roadmap for the project, ensuring both parties share a clear vision of the desired outcome, style, and purpose.

## Core Components of a Strong Brief

### 1. Project Context & Objective

*   **Primary Goal:** What should the illustration achieve? (Inform, persuade, entertain, explain a complex concept)
*   **Target Audience:** Who are we speaking to? (Demographics, interests, cultural context)
*   **Key Message:** What is the single most important idea or feeling to convey?

### 2. Creative Direction & Style
*   **Desired Style:** Be specific. Use references.
