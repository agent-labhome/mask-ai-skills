## Overview
An illustration brief is a structured document that communicates creative requirements from a client to an illustrator. It serves as a roadmap for the project, ensuring both parties share a clear vision of the desired outcome, style, and purpose.

## Core Components of a Strong Brief

### 1. Project Context & Objective
*   **What is the project?** (e.g., Book cover, editorial piece, marketing campaign, icon set)
*   **Primary Goal:** What should the illustration achieve? (Inform, persuade, entertain, explain a complex concept)
*   **Target Audience:** Who are we speaking to? (Demographics, interests, cultural context)
*   **Key Message:** What is the single most important idea or feeling to convey?

### 2. Creative Direction & Style
*   **Desired Style:** Be specific. Use references. (e.g., "Mid-century modern poster art," "Whimsical watercolor," ""},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache
