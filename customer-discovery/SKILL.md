## What is Customer Discovery?
Customer discovery is the systematic process of validating that a problem exists, understanding its nuances, and testing whether your proposed solution resonates with potential customers *before* building anything. It's about getting out of the building to gather evidence, not opinions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Problem First, Solution Second
- Start by deeply understanding the customer's world
- Your initial solution hypothesis is probably wrong
- The goal is to find a problem worth solving, not to sell your idea

### 2. Seek Evidence, Not Validation
- Look for concrete behaviors and past actions
- \"Would you buy this?\" is a terrible question
- \"Tell me about the last time you encountered this problem\" is a great question

### 3. Embrace Negative Feedback
- A \"no\" or \"that won't work\" is more valuable than a polite \"yes\"
- Early criticism saves time and resources
- Your goal is to find the truth, not to be right

## Practical Framework

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)
**Define Your Hypotheses**
- Problem hypothesis: \"We believe [target customer] struggles with [specific problem] when doing [job-to-be-done]\"
- Customer hypothesis: \"We believe [demographics/characteristics] experience this problem most acutely\"
- Solution hypothesis: \"We believe [basic solution concept] would solve this problem\"

**Create Interview Guide**
- 5-7 open-ended questions maximum
- Start with broad context questions
