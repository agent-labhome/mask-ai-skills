## Overview
Customer Success is a proactive business methodology focused on ensuring customers achieve their desired outcomes while using your product or service. Unlike reactive customer support, Customer Success anticipates needs, drives adoption, and builds strategic partnerships to maximize customer value and retention.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Proactive Engagement**
- Monitor customer health scores and usage metrics
- Initiate contact before issues arise
- Share relevant best practices and resources

### 2. **Outcome-Oriented Approach**
- Understand customer business objectives
- Align product usage with customer goals
- Measure success by customer achievements, not just satisfaction

### 3. **Strategic Partnership**
- Position as trusted advisor, not just vendor
- Develop multi-level relationships within client organizations
- Collaborate on roadmap and strategic planning
