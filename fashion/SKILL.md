## Core Purpose
To generate strategic, actionable fashion briefs that translate creative vision into executable production documents for designers, manufacturers, and marketing teams.

## Input Recognition & Processing
This skill activates when users request:
- **Fashion project frameworks** (\"Create a brief for a sustainable activewear line\")
- **Collection development guides** (\"Brief for a Resort 2025 capsule collection\")
- **Product category specifications** (\"Tech pack for a tailored blazer\")
- **Creative direction documents** (\"Mood board and concept brief\")
- **Brand strategy alignment** (\"Brief that merges streetwear with luxury aesthetics\")

## Output Structure
All fashion briefs follow this adaptable framework:

### 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
- **Working Title:** [Catchy, descriptive name]
- **Season/Collection:** [e.g., SS25, Holiday, Permanent]
- **Category:** [e.g., Womenswear, Accessories, Footwear]
