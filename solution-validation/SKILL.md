## What is Solution Validation?
Solution validation is the systematic process of verifying that a proposed solution effectively addresses the original problem, meets requirements, and doesn't introduce unacceptable new issues. It moves beyond \"does it work technically?\" to \"does it solve the right problem effectively and sustainably?\"

## Why This Skill Matters
- **Prevents wasted resources**: Catches flawed solutions before full implementation
- **Reduces unintended consequences**: Identifies secondary problems solutions might create
- **Builds stakeholder confidence**: Provides evidence-based justification for solutions
- **Improves decision quality**: Moves from \"seems right\" to \"demonstrably right\"

## Core Principles

### 1. Problem-Solution Alignment
- Verify the solution actually addresses the root cause, not just symptoms
- Ensure solution scope matches problem boundaries
- Confirm success criteria are measurable and relevant

### 2. Multi-Perspective Evaluation
- Consider technical, business, user, and ethical perspectives
- Assess short-term vs long-term impacts
- Evaluate from different stakeholder viewpoints

### 3. Evidence-Based Validation
- Prefer objective data over subjective opinion
- Use appropriate validation methods for the context
- Document assumptions and their validation status

## Practical Framework: The VALIDATE Method

### V - Verify Problem Understanding
- Restate the problem in your own words
- Confirm problem statement with stakeholders
- Check: \"Are we solving the right problem?\"

**Practice**: Before evaluating any solution, write a one-paragraph problem summary without mentioning the proposed solution.

### A - Assess Against Criteria
