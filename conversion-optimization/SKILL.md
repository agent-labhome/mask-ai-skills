## What is Conversion Optimization?
Conversion optimization (CRO) is the systematic process of increasing the percentage of website visitors who complete desired actions (conversions) through data-driven improvements to user experience, messaging, and design. It combines analytics, user psychology, and experimentation to remove friction and enhance value perception.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Data Over Opinion**
- Start with quantitative (analytics) and qualitative (user feedback) data
- Identify bottlenecks using funnel analysis and session recordings
- Let data guide hypotheses, not personal preferences

### 2. **User-Centric Mindset**
- Understand user intent, objections, and emotional triggers
- Map customer journeys to identify pain points
- Prioritize user needs over internal assumptions

### 3. **Continuous Experimentation**
- CRO is iterative, not a one-time project
- Build a testing roadmap based on potential impact and effort
- Document learnings regardless of test outcome

## Practical Framework: The CRO Process

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis (40% of effort)
**Tools & Methods:**
- **Analytics Audit**: Identify drop-off points in conversion funnels
- **Heatmaps & Recordings**: Visualize user behavior (clicks, scrolls, attention)
- **Surveys & Polls**: Ask visitors about objections and intent
- **Competitor Analysis**: Review competitor conversion paths
- **Technical Audit**: Check page speed, mobile responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility

**Key Questions:**
- Where are users dropping off?
