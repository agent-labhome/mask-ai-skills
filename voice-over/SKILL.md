## Introduction

Voice over (VO) is the art of using your voice to bring scripts to life for various media including commercials, animations, audiobooks, video games, and corporate presentations. Unlike on-camera acting, voice over relies entirely on vocal expression, timing, and emotional authenticity.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity Over Everything** - Every word must be understood
2. **Authenticity** - Sound like a real person, not a \"radio voice\"
3. **Technical Consistency** - Maintain consistent volume, proximity, and tone
4. **Script Servicing** - Your performance serves the message, not your ego

## Practical Guide

### Phase 1: Preparation & Setup

#### Equipment Essentials (Budget to Professional)

**Entry Level ($150-300)**
- USB microphone (Audio-Technica ATR2100x, Rode NT-USB)
- Pop filter
- Basic headphones
- Free DAW: Audacity or GarageBand

**Intermediate ($500-1000)**
- XLR microphone (Rode NT1, Shure SM7B)
- Audio interface (Focusrite Scarlett 2i2)
- Shock mount
- Acoustic treatment panels

**Professional ($2000+)**
- Studio condenser microphone (Neumann TLM 103)
- High-end interface (Universal Audio Apollo)
- Sound-treated booth or room
- Professional DAW (Adobe Audition, Pro Tools)

#### Environment Setup

1. **Room Selection**
   - Choose smallest room available
   - Avoid square rooms (parallel walls cause standing waves)
   - Add soft surfaces: carpets, curtains, furniture

2. **Quick Acoustics**
   - Record in a closet with clothes as natural baffles
   - Use moving blankets on walls
   - Create a \"blanket fort\" around microphone
   - Place microphone away from walls (minimum 1 foot)

3. **Microphone Technique**
   - Position 6-8 inches from mouth
   - Slightly off-axis to reduce plosives
   - Pop filter 2-3 inches from microphone
