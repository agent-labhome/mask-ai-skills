## Overview
Intellectual Property refers to creations of the mind—inventions, literary works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. Effective IP management transforms intangible assets into business value, creates competitive barriers, and mitigates legal risks.

## Core IP Categories

### 1. Patents
**Purpose:** Protect inventions and functional improvements
- **Utility Patents:** Processes, machines, articles of manufacture, compositions (20-year term)
- **Design Patents:** Ornamental designs (15-year term)
- **Plant Patents:** Asexually reproduced plant varieties

**Business Application:**
- Conduct prior art searches before R&D investment
- File provisional patents for early priority dates
- Develop patent landscaping to map competitive space
- Use for fundraising, valuation, and licensing revenue

### 2. Trademarks
**Purpose:** Protect brand identity and consumer recognition
- **Types:** Word marks, logos, slogans, sounds, colors, trade dress
- **Scope:** Protection within specific classes of goods/services
- **Duration:** Renewable indefinitely with continued use

**Business Application:**
- Clear trademarks before brand launch (full search + analysis)
- Register in key markets and expansion territories
- Monitor for infringement and file oppositions when necessary
- Maintain consistent usage guidelines across organization

### 3. Copyrights
**Purpose:** Protect original works of authorship
- **Coverage:** Software code, literary works, music, art, architecture
- **Term:** Life of author + 70 years (corporate works: 95-120 years)
- **Protection:** Automatic upon fixation, registration enhances remedies

**Business Application:**
- Implement copyright notices on all creative works
- Register key works (software, marketing materials, training content)
- Establish clear ownership through employment/contractor agreements
- Develop licensing strategies for content monetization

### 4. Trade Secrets
