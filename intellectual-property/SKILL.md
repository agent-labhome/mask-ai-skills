### 1. Foundational Knowledge
**Core IP Types:**
- **Copyright:** Protects original works of authorship (books, music, software, art)
  - Duration: Life of author + 70 years (varies by jurisdiction)
  - Automatic upon creation (registration strengthens enforcement)
- **Trademarks:** Protects brands, logos, slogans (® and ™ symbols)
  - Requires distinctiveness and use in commerce
  - Must be defended against genericide
- **Patents:** Protects inventions and processes (utility, design, plant)
  - Requires novelty, non-obviousness, and utility
  - 20-year monopoly in exchange for public disclosure
- **Trade Secrets:** Confidential business information (formulas, processes, lists)
  - Protected indefinitely while secret
  - Requires reasonable security measures

### 2. Practical Applications

**For Creators/Developers:**
- Document creation process with dates (proves originality)
- Use © notice: \"Copyright [Year] [Owner]. All rights reserved.\"
- Register important works with national copyright office
- Implement \"watermarking\" for digital assets
- Use open-source licenses correctly (GPL, MIT, Creative Commons)

**For Businesses:**
- Conduct trademark searches before branding
- File provisional patents for early protection
- Implement trade secret protocols (NDAs, access controls, employee training)
- Create IP assignment clauses in employment contracts
- Regular IP audits to identify and protect assets

**For Users/Consumers:**
- Understand \"fair use\" factors: purpose, nature, amount, market effect
- Recognize public domain works (expired copyright, government works)
- Use royalty-free/stock resources appropriately
