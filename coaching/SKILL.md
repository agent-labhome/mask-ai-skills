## What is Coaching?

Coaching is a structured conversation process that empowers individuals or teams to maximize their personal and professional potential. Unlike mentoring (sharing experience) or consulting (providing expertise), coaching focuses on unlocking a person's own insights and resources through powerful questioning and active listening.

## Core Principles

1. **Client-Centered**: The coachee has the answers; the coach facilitates discovery
2. **Solution-Focused**: Oriented toward future possibilities, not past problems
3. **Action-Oriented**: Leads to concrete commitments and behavioral change
4. **Confidential**: Creates a safe space for exploration
5. **Non-Judgmental**: Accepts the client's perspective without evaluation
