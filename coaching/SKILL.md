## Overview
Coaching is a structured process that empowers individuals or teams to achieve specific personal or professional goals through guidance, support, and accountability. Unlike mentoring (which shares experience) or consulting (which provides solutions), coaching facilitates self-discovery and self-directed growth.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Client-Centered Approach**
- The client is resourceful and whole
- Agenda and solutions come from the client
- Coach maintains non-judgmental presence

### 2. **Active Listening**
- Hearing beyond words to emotions and values
- Noticing patterns and inconsistencies
- Listening without preparing responses

### 3. **Powerful Questioning**
- Open-ended questions that provoke insight
- Forward-focused rather than problem-focused
- Questions that challenge assumptions

### 4. **Creating Awareness**
- Helping clients recognize patterns
- Connecting thoughts, emotions, and behaviors
- Identifying blind spots

### 5. **Designing Actions**
- Co-creating actionable steps
- Building accountability structures
- Encouraging experimentation
