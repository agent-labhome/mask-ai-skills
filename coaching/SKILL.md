## Overview
A coaching brief is a structured document that outlines the purpose, goals, and framework for a coaching engagement. It serves as a foundational agreement between the coach and the coachee (and often their organization) to ensure clarity, alignment, and focus.

## Core Purpose
To establish a clear, shared understanding of the coaching engagement’s objectives, process, boundaries, and success metrics.

## Key Components of a Coaching Brief

### 1. **Context & Background**
*   **Organizational Context:** Why is coaching being offered? (e.g., leadership development, performance improvement, onboarding, career transition).
*   **Coachee Profile:** Brief background on the coachee (role, tenure, key strengths, and the stated reason for coaching).
*   **Sponsor/Stakeholders:** Who is sponsoring or has a vested interest in this engagement? (e.g., manager, HR Business Partner).
