## Overview
Lighting is the art of controlling light and shadow to shape visual perception, direct attention, and evoke emotion. It transforms flat geometry into dimensional space, defines texture and form, and fundamentally determines the mood and narrative tone of a scene. Mastering lighting is less about technical correctness and more about intentional visual storytelling.

## Core Principles

### 1. **The Three-Point Lighting System** (Foundation)
The classic starting point for illuminating a subject clearly and dimensionally.

- **Key Light:** The primary, strongest light source. It defines the dominant illumination and creates the main shadows. Place it at a 30-45 degree angle from the camera.
- **Fill Light:** A softer, secondary light that reduces contrast by filling in shadows created by the key. It should be less intense (typically 30-50% of the key's power) and placed opposite the key.
- **Back Light (Rim/Hair Light):** Positioned behind the subject, opposite the camera. It separates the subject from the background by creating a bright rim or halo around their edges, adding depth and pop.

> **Pro Insight:** In modern CG and photography, this is a starting grammar, not a rule. Often, a single, well-placed key light with natural fill (bounce) is more cinematic than an obvious three-point setup.

### 2. **Light Quality: Hard vs. Soft**
- **Hard Light:** Comes from a small, direct source (sun, bare bulb). Creates sharp, well-defined shadows with high contrast. Suggests drama, intensity, clarity, or harsh environments (noon sun, interrogation room).
- **Soft Light:** Comes from a large, diffused source (overcast sky, softbox). Creates gentle, gradual shadows with low contrast. Suggests calmness, safety, romance, or neutral observation.
  - **Rule:** The *relative size* of the light source to the subject determines softness. A large, close source is soft. A small, distant source is hard.

### 3. **Light Direction & Emotional Language**
The angle of light tells a subconscious story.
