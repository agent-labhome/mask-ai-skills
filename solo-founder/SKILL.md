## 功能

## Metadata
- **Framework**: SKILL (Strategy, Knowledge, Implementation, Leverage, Longevity)
- **Target**: Solo founders, indie hackers, solopreneurs
- **Focus**: Sustainable solo entrepreneurship
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Created**: For resource-constrained individual founders

## Practical Guide: The SKILL Framework

### S - Strategy & Systems
**Objective**: Work smarter, not harder with limited resources

**Practical Actions**:
1. **Ruthless Prioritization**
   - Use the \"One Thing\" principle daily: What's the ONE thing that makes everything else easier?
   - Implement the Eisenhower Matrix weekly
   - Set quarterly themes instead of detailed plans

2. **Systematize Everything**
   - Document all repeatable processes (onboarding, deployment, customer support)
   - Create decision frameworks for common scenarios
   - Build templates for emails, proposals, and code

3. **Lean Validation**
   - Test assumptions with minimal viable products (MVPs)
   - Use landing pages before building
   - Conduct problem interviews (5-10 conversations)

### K - Knowledge Management
**Objective**: Continuously learn without getting overwhelmed

**Practical Actions**:
1. **Curated Learning**
   - Follow 3-5 industry experts max (not 50)
   - Read one business book and one technical book per quarter
   - Maintain a \"knowledge vault\" (Notion/Roam/Obsidian)

2. **Just-in-Time Learning**
   - Learn skills when you need them, not \"just in case\"
   - Master the 80/20 of each required skill
   - Use project-based learning

3. **Network Intelligence**
   - Build a \"brain trust\" of 3-5 fellow founders
   - Join one high-quality community (paid groups often filter better)
   - Schedule monthly \"learning exchanges\"

### I - Implementation & Execution
**Objective**: Maintain consistent momentum

**Practical Actions**:
1. **Rhythm Over Goals**
   - Establish non-negotiable work rhythms (e.g., \"3 hours of deep work daily\")
   - Use time blocking: Creation (AM), Communication (Midday), Administration (PM)
   - Implement weekly reviews every Friday

2. **Micro-Progress Tracking**
   - Break projects into 2-hour tasks max
   - Use public accountability (build in"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":519,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":19},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
