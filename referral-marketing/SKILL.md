## Core Concepts
* **Referral Program:** A structured system that incentivizes existing customers to recommend your product/service to others.
* **Viral Coefficient:** Measures how many new users each existing user brings in.
* **Double-Sided Incentive:** Rewarding both the referrer and the referee increases participation.

## Key Components
1.  **Incentive Structure:** Choose rewards (discount, credit, cash, feature access) that are valuable and relevant to your audience.
2.  **Mechanics & Ease:** Make sharing simple (unique links, one-click social sharing) and tracking transparent.
3.  **Promotion & Communication:** Announce the program via email, in-app messages, and dedicated landing pages.
4.  **Tracking & Analytics:** Monitor key metrics like share rate, conversion rate, and customer lifetime value (LTV) of referred users.
