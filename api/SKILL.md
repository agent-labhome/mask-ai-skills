## Purpose
Create clear, concise API specifications that serve as the single source of truth for API development, documentation, and client integration.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Clarity Over Completeness**
- Start with the essential endpoints and expand iteratively
- Use plain language before technical specifications
- Focus on the \"why\" before the \"how\"

### 2. **Consumer-First Design**
- Design from the API consumer's perspective
- Include realistic use cases and examples
- Anticipate common integration patterns

### 3. **Consistency Across Layers**
- Maintain consistent patterns across endpoints
- Use standardized response formats
- Apply uniform error handling
