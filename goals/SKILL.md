## Purpose
This skill helps users articulate their goals and requirements clearly, transforming vague ideas into structured briefs. It's particularly useful at the start of projects, planning sessions, or when defining objectives.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Goal Clarification
- **Eliciting Objectives**: Asking questions to uncover primary and secondary goals
- **Prioritization**: Helping users rank what matters most (speed, quality, budget, innovation, etc.)
- **Success Metrics**: Defining what success looks like with measurable criteria
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Determining who needs to be involved or informed

### 2. Brief Development
- **Structured Frameworks**: Using templates (SMART goals, project briefs, creative briefs)
- **Scope Definition**: Clarifying what's in/out of scope
- **Constraint Identification**: Uncovering limitations (time, budget, resources, technical)
- **Context Building**: Understanding the broader situation"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
