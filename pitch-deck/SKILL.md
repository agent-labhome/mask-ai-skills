## Purpose
Transform complex business ideas into a clear, compelling pitch deck brief that aligns stakeholders and guides deck creation.

## Core Principles
- **Audience-First**: Tailor every element to investor priorities and attention spans
- **Story-Driven**: Frame as a narrative, not just data presentation
- **Problem-Centric**: Start with the pain point, not the solution
- **Visual Thinking**: Design for glanceability and emotional impact

## Key Components
1. **Problem Statement** (1-2 sentences)
   - Whose pain? How acute? Current alternatives?
   
2. **Solution** (1 sentence + 3 bullet points)
   - Core value proposition
   - Key differentiators

3. **Market Opportunity** (TAM/SAM/SOM)
   - Top-down and bottom-up validation
   - Growth trajectory

4. **Business Model**
   - Revenue streams
