**Core Goal:** Acquire proficiency in a new language for communication and comprehension.

## Key Principles
*   **Consistency > Intensity:** Short, daily practice beats occasional long sessions.
*   **Comprehensible Input:** Engage with material you mostly understand.
*   **Active Use:** Practice speaking and writing, not just listening and reading.

## Essential Methods
1.  **Foundation:** Use an app (Duolingo, Memrise) or course for basic grammar/vocab.
2.  **Immersion:** Consume media (music, shows, podcasts) in the target language.
3.  **Practice:** Use platforms like iTalki, Tandem, or HelloTalk to speak with natives.
4.  **SRS:** Apply spaced repetition (Anki, Quizlet) for vocabulary retention.
5.  **Output:** Keep a simple journal or record yourself speaking regularly.

## Quickstart Routine (20-30 min/day)
