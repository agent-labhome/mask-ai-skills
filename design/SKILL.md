## Purpose
Create clear, actionable design briefs that align stakeholders, define project scope, and establish measurable success criteria.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity over completeness**: Focus on essential information that drives decisions
- **Problem-first approach**: Start with user/business problems, not solutions
- **Collaborative foundation**: Briefs should invite input, not dictate outcomes
- **Measurable outcomes**: Every brief must define what success looks like

## Key Components

### 1. Project Context
- Business objectives and constraints
- User problems/opportunities
- Current state assessment
- Success metrics (KPIs, OKRs)

### 2. Scope & Deliverables
- Clear boundaries (in-scope vs. out-of-scope)
- Tangible outputs (wireframes, prototypes, etc.)
- Timeline and milestones
- Resource requirements
