## Overview
A **Design Brief** is a strategic document that outlines the objectives, scope, and requirements of a design project. It serves as a foundational agreement between stakeholders and designers, ensuring alignment on goals, deliverables, and constraints. This skill involves creating, interpreting, and utilizing design briefs to guide the design process effectively.

   - **Client/Stakeholder**: Primary contact and decision-makers.
   - **Date**: When the brief was created or last updated.
   - **Background**: Context, history, and rationale for the project.

### 2. **Objectives & Goals**

   - **Specific Objectives**: Measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Increase website conversions by 15%\").
