## Purpose
Create clear, actionable design briefs that align stakeholders, define project scope, and establish success criteria for design projects.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity over completeness** – Focus on essential information
- **Problem-first approach** – Start with user/business needs, not solutions
- **Actionable language** – Use specific, measurable terms
- **Collaborative framing** – Briefs are starting points, not final decrees

## Key Components
1. **Project Context** – Why this project exists now
2. **Objectives** – What success looks like (business + user goals)
3. **Target Audience** – Who we're designing for
4. **Scope & Constraints** – What's in/out of bounds
5. **Success Metrics** – How we'll measure impact
6. **Timeline & Deliverables** – What, when, and to whom
