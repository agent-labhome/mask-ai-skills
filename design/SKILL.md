## Overview
A **Design Brief** is a strategic document that outlines the objectives, scope, and requirements for a design project. It serves as a critical communication tool between stakeholders (clients, managers) and the design team, ensuring alignment, clarity, and a shared vision from the outset.

This skill involves the ability to **create, interpret, and execute** a design brief effectively.

## Core Components of a Design Brief

A well-structured brief typically includes:

1.  **Project Overview & Background:** Context about the company, product, or service. Why is this project needed now?
2.  **Objectives & Goals:** What are the specific, measurable outcomes? (e.g., Increase user sign-ups by 15%, refresh brand to appeal to a younger demographic).
3.  **Target Audience:** Who are we designing for? Include demographics, psychographics, behaviors, and pain points.
4.  **Scope of Work:** Clearly defined deliverables"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
