# SKILL.md: Coding

## Core Principles
- **Write for humans first, computers second** â Code is read more often than written
- **Keep it simple** â Complexity is the enemy of maintenance
- **Be explicit** â Avoid clever tricks that obscure intent

## Key Practices
- **Single Responsibility** â Each function/class should do one thing well
- **Meaningful Names** â Variables/functions should reveal their purpose
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** â Extract reusable patterns
- **Test early** â Write tests alongside code, not after

## Brief Guidelines
- **Functions** â Keep small (<20 lines), clear inputs/outputs
- **Comments** â Explain "why," not "what" (code should be self-documenting)
- **Error handling** â Fail gracefully with helpful messages
- **Version control** â Commit often with descriptive messages
