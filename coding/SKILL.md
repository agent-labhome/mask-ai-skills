## Core Principles
- **Write for humans first, computers second** – Code is read more often than written
- **Keep it simple** – Complexity is the enemy of maintenance
- **Be explicit** – Avoid clever tricks that obscure intent

## Key Practices
- **Single Responsibility** – Each function/class should do one thing well
- **Meaningful Names** – Variables/functions should reveal their purpose
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** – Extract reusable patterns
- **Test early** – Write tests alongside code, not after

## Brief Guidelines
- **Functions** – Keep small (<20 lines), clear inputs/outputs
- **Comments** – Explain \"why,\" not \"what\" (code should be self-documenting)
- **Error handling** – Fail gracefully with helpful messages
- **Version control** – Commit often with descriptive messages

## Before Shipping
- [ ] Code works as intended
