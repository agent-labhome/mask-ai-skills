## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Cleverness** – Write code others can understand immediately.
2. **Solve the Right Problem** – Understand requirements before writing a line.
3. **Simple First** – Start with the most straightforward solution that works.

## Workflow
- **Plan**: Outline approach, consider edge cases.
- **Implement**: Write clean, focused code with meaningful names.
- **Test**: Verify functionality, handle errors gracefully.
- **Review**: Refactor for clarity and efficiency.

## Key Practices
- Write small, single-purpose functions
- Comment *why*, not *what*
- Version control with clear commits
- Learn the language/framework idioms

## Mindset
Code is communication—with computers and future developers (including yourself).
