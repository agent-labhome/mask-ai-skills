## What It Is
Systematically analyzing information to form reasoned judgments.

## Core Actions
- **Question assumptions** – challenge the obvious
- **Evaluate evidence** – separate fact from opinion
- **Consider context** – understand the bigger picture
- **Identify biases** – recognize your own and others’
- **Draw logical conclusions** – connect evidence to outcomes

## Quick Framework
1. **Clarify** – What’s the real problem/question?
2. **Gather** – What information is relevant?
3. **Analyze** – What connections, gaps, or biases exist?
4. **Conclude** – What’s the most reasonable judgment?
5. **Review** – What might I be missing?

## Key Mindset
Be intellectually humble. Seek truth, not confirmation.

## Anti-Patterns
- Jumping to conclusions
- Confusing correlation with causation
