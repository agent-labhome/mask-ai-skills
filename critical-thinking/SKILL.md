## Purpose
Systematically analyze information to form reasoned judgments and make effective decisions.

## Core Process
1. **Clarify** – Define the question, identify assumptions, and gather relevant information.
2. **Analyze** – Examine evidence, recognize patterns, and identify logical relationships.
3. **Evaluate** – Assess credibility of sources, check for biases, and weigh arguments.
4. **Conclude** – Synthesize information to form a well-reasoned judgment or solution.
5. **Reflect** – Review the process, consider alternatives, and identify potential improvements.

## Key Principles
- Question assumptions (yours and others')
- Separate facts from opinions
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Tolerate ambiguity when evidence is incomplete
- Base conclusions on evidence, not emotions

## Quick Check
Before finalizing any decision or conclusion, ask:
- What evidence supports this?
- What alternative explanations exist?
- What are the potential biases"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":216,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
