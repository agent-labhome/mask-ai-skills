**What it is:** The objective analysis and evaluation of information to form a reasoned judgment.

**Core Actions:**
1.  **Question** assumptions and surface-level information.
2.  **Gather** relevant data and evidence from reliable sources.
3.  **Analyze** by breaking down arguments, identifying biases, and recognizing logical connections.
4.  **Interpret** the meaning and significance of the information.
5.  **Synthesize** different pieces of information to form a new understanding or solution.
6.  **Evaluate** the strength of evidence and the validity of conclusions.
7.  **Communicate** your reasoning clearly and logically.

**Key Mindset:** Curiosity over certainty. It's not about being critical of others, but about rigorous thinking.

**Use it when:** Making decisions, solving problems, evaluating claims, or learning something new."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":182,"total_tokens":198,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
