## Purpose
A leadership brief is a concise, structured communication that enables leaders to make informed decisions, align teams, and drive action. This skill focuses on delivering critical information clearly, efficiently, and with strategic intent.

## Core Principles

**Clarity Over Completeness**
- Prioritize the essential 20% of information that drives 80% of the decision.
- Use plain language; avoid jargon unless universally understood by the audience.
- State the bottom line up front (BLUF).

**Strategic Alignment**
- Connect information directly to organizational goals and priorities.
- Frame issues within the broader mission and context.
- Highlight implications, not just facts.

**Action Orientation**
- Every brief should lead to a clear decision, action, or behavioral change.
- Include specific, actionable recommendations.
- Define next steps and ownership.
