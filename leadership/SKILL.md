## What This Is
A concise, structured method for delivering critical information to teams and stakeholders in high-stakes situations. It transforms complex scenarios into actionable clarity.

## Core Principles

**1. Situation First**
- Start with the current reality
- State facts, not assumptions
- Establish shared context immediately

**2. Mission Clarity**
- Define the single objective
- Use \"so that\" to connect purpose to outcome
- Keep it memorable and repeatable

**3. Intent Over Instruction**
- Share your strategic thinking (\"Here's why we're doing this...\")
- Explain the desired end state
- Empower decentralized decision-making

**4. Structure Follows Function**
- Organize information by what people need to act
- Use the simplest possible framework
