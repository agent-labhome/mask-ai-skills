**Core Definition:** The ability to guide, influence, and enable others to achieve a common goal.

**Key Behaviors:**
*   **Sets Direction:** Clearly communicates vision, purpose, and objectives.
*   **Empowers Others:** Delegates effectively, provides resources, and trusts team members.
*   **Takes Responsibility:** Owns outcomes, both successes and failures.
*   **Inspires Action:** Motivates through clarity, example, and recognition.
*   **Makes Decisions:** Weighs information, commits to a course, and adapts as needed.

**Antipatterns (What Leadership Is Not):**
*   Micromanaging tasks and decisions.
*   Taking credit for team successes while assigning blame for failures.
*   Providing vague or constantly shifting goals.
*   Hoarding information or authority.

**In Practice:** Leadership is exercised at all levels, not just formal authority. It's about creating an environment where the team can succeed"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
