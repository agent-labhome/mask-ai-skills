## Overview
Native advertising is a paid media strategy where ads match the form, function, and feel of the surrounding editorial content. Unlike traditional display ads, native ads are designed to blend seamlessly with the user experience while being clearly labeled as sponsored content. This skill involves creating non-disruptive advertising that provides value to the audience while achieving marketing objectives.

- Provides genuine value to the audience
- Solves problems or entertains rather than just selling
- Aligns with audience interests and platform context
