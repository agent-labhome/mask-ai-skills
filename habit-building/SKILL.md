## Overview
Habit building is the systematic process of creating automatic behaviors through consistent repetition. Unlike motivation-based actions, habits operate on neurological loops that make behaviors automatic over time. This skill enables sustainable personal and professional growth by reducing decision fatigue and increasing consistency.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Habit Loop (Cue → Routine → Reward)
- **Cue**: Trigger that initiates the behavior (time, location, emotional state, preceding action)
- **Routine**: The behavior itself
- **Reward**: Positive reinforcement that satisfies a craving

### 2. The 3 R's of Habit Formation
- **Reminder**: The cue that triggers the habit
- **Routine**: The behavior performed
- **Reward**: The benefit gained from doing the behavior

### 3. The Two-Minute Rule
Start new habits by scaling them down to take two minutes or less. This lowers the activation energy required to begin.

## Practical Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Preparation (Days 1-3)
1. **Identify Keystone Habit**: Choose one habit that will create positive ripple effects
2. **Clarify \"Why"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":300,"total_tokens":319,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":19},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
