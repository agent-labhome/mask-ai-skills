## Overview
Focus is the ability to direct and sustain your attention on a single task or objective while minimizing distractions. It’s a foundational skill for productivity, learning, and achieving high-quality outcomes in any field. In a world of constant notifications and multitasking, focused attention has become both rare and valuable.

## Core Principles

1. **Single-Tasking**: The brain is not designed for effective multitasking. Focus means doing one thing at a time with full engagement.
2. **Attention is a Muscle**: It can be trained and strengthened through practice, but it also fatigues and needs recovery.
3. **Environmental Control**: Your surroundings significantly influence your ability to focus. Design them to support, not hinder, concentration.
4. **Mental Clarity**: A cluttered or anxious mind struggles to focus. Clarity precedes concentration.

## Practical Framework

- **Gather Resources**: Have everything you need (tools, documents, information) ready before you start to avoid mid-flow interruptions.
