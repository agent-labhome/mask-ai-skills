## Overview
**Focus.Brief** is a minimalist productivity tool designed to help users maintain laser focus on their most important tasks. It combines the principles of single-tasking with structured time management to combat distraction and increase productivity.

## Core Features

### 1. **Single-Task Focus**
- **One Task at a Time**: Users can only work on one predefined task during a focus session
- **Task Locking**: Once a session starts, the task cannot be changed, preventing task-switching
- **Clear Intent**: Forces users to define exactly what they'll accomplish before starting

### 2. **Structured Time Management**
- **Flexible Timers**: Customizable focus durations (25, 50, 90 minutes or custom)
- **Smart Breaks**: Automatic break suggestions based on session length
- **Session Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and completion statistics

### 3. **Minimalist Interface**
