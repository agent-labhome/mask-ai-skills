## Overview
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a fundamental data integration process that involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a target system for analysis and decision-making.

## Core Components

### 1. **Extract**
- **Purpose**: Gather data from multiple heterogeneous sources
- **Common Sources**:
  - Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
  - APIs (REST, SOAP)
  - Flat files (CSV, JSON, XML, Excel)
  - Cloud storage
  - Streaming data sources
  - Legacy systems

### 2. **Transform**
- **Purpose**: Clean, structure, and prepare data for analysis
- **Key Operations**:
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)
  - Data validation and quality checks
  - Format conversion
  - Aggregation and summarization"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
