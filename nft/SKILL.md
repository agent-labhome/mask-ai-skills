## What is an NFT?

An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset verified using blockchain technology. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (which are fungible and interchangeable), each NFT has distinct properties and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Non-Fungibility**
- Each token is unique with distinct metadata
- Cannot be exchanged equivalently like currency
- Comparable to original artwork vs. prints

### 2. **Smart Contracts**
- Self-executing contracts with terms in code
- Govern NFT creation, ownership, and transfers
- Typically ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards on Ethereum

### 3. **Token Standards**
- **ERC-721**: Original NFT standard, each token unique
- **ERC-1155**: More efficient, can handle both fungible and non-fungible tokens
- **Other chains**: Solana (Metaplex), Flow, Polygon, etc.

### 4. **Metadata & Storage**
- On-chain vs. off-chain storage
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage
