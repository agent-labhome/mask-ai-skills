- **Related Skills**: User Research, Interviewing, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing

## What is Problem Validation?
Problem validation is the systematic process of confirming that a perceived user pain point is **real, widespread, and worth solving** before investing in solutions. It shifts the focus from \"Can we build it?\" to \"Should we build it?\" by answering three core questions:
1. Is this problem **real** for users?
2. Does it **matter enough** that users would seek a solution?
3. Is solving it **valuable** to our business?

## Why It Matters
- **Prevents wasted effort**: 60-80% of product features are rarely or never used (Pendo, Standish Group)
- **Improves product-market fit**: Teams that validate problems before solutions are 2.3x more likely to succeed (Product Management Festival)
- **Builds alignment**: Creates shared understanding across teams about what to build and why
- **Reduces risk**: Lessens dependency on assumptions and intuition alone

## Core Principles

### 1. Separate Problems from Solutions
- **Problem**: \"I waste 30 minutes daily searching for project files\"
- **Solution ideas**: Better search, automated tagging, standardized naming (all come AFTER validation)

### 2. Seek Evidence, Not Just Opinions
- Move beyond \"I think users want X\" to \"We observed Y behavior and heard Z pain points\"

### 3. Quantify When Possible
- How many users experience this?
- How frequently?
- What's the measurable impact?

## Validation Framework

### Step 1: Problem Discovery
**Activities:**
- User interviews (open-ended, not leading"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":400,"total_tokens":418,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
