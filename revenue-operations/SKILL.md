**Name:** Revenue Operations (RevOps)  
**Description:** A strategic function that aligns sales, marketing, and customer success operations, technology, and data to drive efficient, predictable, and scalable revenue growth.  
**Triggers:** Revenue plateau, funnel misalignment, inconsistent customer experience, data silos between teams, inefficient tech stack, poor lead-to-cash process visibility, or scaling go-to-market motions.

## Core Responsibilities

*   **Process & Alignment:** Design, document, and enforce the integrated revenue process from lead to renewal. Break down silos between marketing, sales, and customer success.
*   **Technology & Systems:** Own, administer, and optimize the revenue tech stack (CRM, MAP, CPQ, etc.). Ensure data flows seamlessly between systems.
*   **Data & Insights:** Establish a single source of truth for revenue metrics. Provide analytics and reporting on pipeline health, forecasting accuracy, and funnel performance.
*   **Enablement:** Equip revenue-generating teams with tools, training, and content to improve effectiveness.
*   **Governance:** Maintain data hygiene, enforce process compliance, and manage system access and security.
