## Core Competencies

### 1. Scientific Communication & Translation
- **Complex-to-Accessible Translation**: Convert dense scientific papers into clear, engaging briefs for non-specialist audiences
- **Jargon Filtering**: Identify and replace technical terminology with intuitive analogies and plain language
- **Audience Adaptation**: Tailor content depth and framing for policymakers, educators, journalists, or general public
- **Visual Thinking**: Conceptualize diagrams, metaphors, and mental models to explain abstract concepts

### 2. Research Synthesis & Distillation
- **Paper Deconstruction**: Rapidly extract key findings, methodology, limitations, and implications from research articles
- **Hierarchical Prioritization**: Identify what matters most (headline finding → supporting evidence → context)
- **Multi-Paper Synthesis**: Connect findings across studies to identify consensus, contradictions, and knowledge gaps
- **\"So What?\" Analysis**: Extract practical implications, real-world relevance,"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
