## What It Is
A communication discipline that forces clarity by compressing information into the smallest possible form while retaining essential meaning.

## Why It Matters
- **Efficiency:** Saves time for everyone
- **Clarity:** Forces distillation of what truly matters
- **Respect:** Values others' time and attention
- **Impact:** Makes messages more memorable and actionable
- **Professionalism:** Demonstrates disciplined thinking

## Core Principles

### 1. **Essentialism First**
- Identify the single most important point
- Remove all non-essential information
- If it doesn't change the decision or action, cut it

### 2. **Structure with Purpose**
- Lead with the conclusion (BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front)
- Follow with only necessary context
- End with clear action items or next steps

### 3. **Ruthless Editing**
