## Purpose
Create clear, concise service briefs that align stakeholders and define project scope.

## Key Elements
- **Objective**: Primary goal and business impact
- **Scope**: Inclusions, exclusions, and boundaries
- **Stakeholders**: Key roles and responsibilities
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes and KPIs
- **Timeline**: Key milestones and deadlines
- **Constraints**: Budget, resources, and limitations

## Best Practices
- Start with the \"why\" before the \"what\"
- Keep it to one page when possible
- Use plain language, avoid jargon
- Define what's out of scope explicitly
- Align with business objectives
- Review with stakeholders before finalizing

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Vague objectives without measurable outcomes
- Unrealistic timelines or budgets
- Missing stakeholder alignment
