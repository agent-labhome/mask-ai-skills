## What is Habits. Brief.?
A minimalist, privacy-focused habit tracker for iOS and Android. It strips away all complexity, gamification, and social features to focus on one thing: helping you build consistency.

## Core Philosophy
*   **Less is more.** No graphs, no streaks, no levels. Just a clean list and a checkmark.
*   **Privacy by design.** No accounts, no cloud sync (unless you choose iCloud/Google Drive), no data collection.
*   **Effortless logging.** Adding or completing a habit should take seconds.

## Key Features
1.  **The List:** A simple, customizable list of habits.
2.  **The Check:** Tap a habit to mark it done for today. A subtle visual confirmation (e.g., a filled circle) appears.
3.  **Daily Reset:** At midnight (or a user-defined time), all checks are cleared for a fresh start.
