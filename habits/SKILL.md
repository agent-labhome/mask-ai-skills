## Overview
**Habits** is a minimalist, keyboard-driven habit tracker for the terminal. It helps you build and maintain daily routines through a simple, focused interface that stays out of your way.

## Core Philosophy
- **Atomic Actions:** Each habit is a single, clear action.
- **Consistency Over Perfection:** Tracks streaks to encourage showing up daily.
- **Minimalist Design:** No complex charts or overwhelming data—just your habits and your streak.
