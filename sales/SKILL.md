## Practical Overview

Sales is the process of identifying, engaging, and converting potential buyers into customers while maintaining relationships to encourage repeat business and referrals. It blends art (relationship-building) with science (process and data).

### Core Components

1. **Prospecting**  
   - Identifying potential customers through research, networking, or inbound leads.  
   - Tools: LinkedIn Sales Navigator, CRM systems, industry databases.  
   - Practical tip: Dedicate at least 2 hours daily to prospecting; aim for quality over quantity.

2. **Qualification**  
   - Assessing if a prospect has the need, budget, authority, and timeline to buy.  
   - Use frameworks like **BANT** (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) or **MEDDIC** (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion).  
   - Practical tip: Ask open-ended questions early to uncover true needs and constraints.

3. **Presentation/Pitching**  
   - Tailoring your product/service story to the prospect’s specific pain points.  
   - Focus on benefits, not just features. Use storytelling to make it memorable.  
   - Practical tip: Practice a 60-second “elevator pitch” and a 10-minute detailed demo.

4. **Handling Objections**  
   - Common objections: price, timing, trust, competition.  
   - Technique: **LAER** (Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond). Never argue.  
   - Practical tip: Prepare rebuttals for the top 5 objections you hear regularly.

5. **Closing**  
   - Asking for the sale clearly and confidently.  
   - Methods: Assumptive close (“Shall we start with the annual plan?”), Urgency"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":450,"total_tokens":467,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":17},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
