## Practical Guide to TikTok Growth

### 1. Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-2)

**Account Optimization**
- Choose a memorable username (under 24 characters)
- Create a professional profile photo (clear face or brand logo)
- Write a compelling bio with:
  - Who you are/what you do
  - What value you provide
  - Relevant keywords
  - Call-to-action (link in bio)
- Enable \"Switch to Pro Account\" for analytics

**Content Strategy Development**
- Identify your niche (be specific: not \"fitness\" but \"postpartum fitness for busy moms\")
- Research 5-10 successful creators in your niche
- Analyze their top 3 performing videos (note patterns in content, hooks, length)
- Create a content pillar system (3-5 main topics you'll rotate through)

### 2. Content Creation System

**Hook Formula (First 3 Seconds)**
- Start with action or surprising visual
- Ask a provocative question
- Use text overlay with curiosity gap
- Example: \"Stop doing this if you want more views →\"

**Video Structure**
- 0-3s: Hook
- 3-15s: Value delivery
- 15-20s: Engagement prompt (ask question, encourage duet/stitch)
- 20s+: Additional value or call-to-action

**Optimal Video Specifications**
- Length: 21-34 seconds (sweet spot for algorithm)
- Format: 9:16 vertical (1080x1920)
- Captions: Always use on-screen text (85% watch without sound)
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant (mix of niche-specific and broad)
- Sound: Use trending audio when relevant

### 3. Posting Strategy

**Consistency Schedule**
- Start: 1 video daily for first 30 days
- Ideal times (test for your audience):
  - Weekdays: 7-9 AM, 12-2 PM, 7-11 PM
