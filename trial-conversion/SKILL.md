## Overview
Trial Conversion is the systematic process of turning free trial users into paying customers. This skill combines analytics, user psychology, and strategic communication to optimize the path from trial sign-up to subscription purchase.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Conversion Funnel Stages**
- **Awareness**: User discovers your product
- **Activation**: User experiences core value (the \"aha moment\")
- **Adoption**: User integrates product into workflow
- **Advocacy**: User becomes promoter
- **Conversion**: User becomes paying customer

### 2. **Key Metrics**
- **Trial-to-Paid Rate**: Percentage of trials converting to paid
- **Time to Convert**: Average days from trial start to conversion
- **Activation Rate**: Percentage completing key setup steps
- **Feature Adoption**: Usage of premium features during trial
- **Churn Risk**: Indicators of potential non-conversion

### 3. **Psychological Triggers**
- **Loss Aversion**: Fear of losing access to value
- **Social Proof**: Evidence of others finding value
- **Scarcity**: Limited time or special offers
- **Reciprocity**: Value given creates obligation to return value

## Practical Guide
