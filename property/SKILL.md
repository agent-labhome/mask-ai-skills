## Core Competency
**Defining and managing the essential attributes of an object, entity, or system.**

This skill involves identifying, articulating, and maintaining the fundamental characteristics that define something's nature, behavior, and value. It's about moving from a vague concept to a concrete, actionable definition.

## Key Actions & Behaviors

*   **Identification & Articulation:** Pinpointing the core, non-negotiable attributes of a subject. Asking: \"What are its defining features? What must it have or be?\"
*   **Clarity & Specificity:** Describing properties in clear, unambiguous terms. Avoiding vagueness in favor of measurable or observable criteria.
*   **Constraint Setting:** Establishing the boundaries, rules, or limitations that govern the property (e.g., data type, range, format, dependencies).
*   **Validation & Integrity:** Ensuring that any instance or manifestation of the subject adheres to its defined properties.
