## Metadata

## Overview

Nutrition is the science of how food affects the body, encompassing the study of nutrients, dietary patterns, and their impact on health, performance, and disease prevention. Mastering nutrition enables you to make informed food choices that support your specific health goals, whether that's weight management, athletic performance, chronic disease prevention, or general wellbeing.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Macronutrients** (Required in large amounts)
- **Proteins:** Building blocks for tissues, enzymes, hormones (4 kcal/g)
  - Complete (animal sources, soy, quinoa) vs. incomplete proteins
  - Recommended: 0.8-2.2g/kg body weight depending on activity
- **Carbohydrates:** Primary energy source (4 kcal/g)
  - Simple (sugars) vs. complex (starches, fiber)
  - Fiber: soluble (lowers cholesterol) and insoluble (aids digestion)
- **Fats:** Energy storage, hormone production, nutrient absorption (9 kcal/g)
  - Saturated, unsaturated (mono/poly), trans fats
  - Essential fatty acids: omega-3 and omega-6

### 2. **Micronutrients** (Vitamins & Minerals)
- **Fat-soluble vitamins:** A, D, E, K (stored in body)
- **Water-soluble vitamins:** B-complex, C (excreted regularly)
- **Major minerals:** Calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium
- **Trace minerals:** Iron, zinc, selenium, iodine

### 3. **Energy Balance**
- Calories in vs. calories out
- Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
- Adaptive thermogenesis and metabolic adaptation

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
