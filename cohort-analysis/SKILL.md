# Cohort Analysis

## Metadata
- **Name:** cohort_analysis
- **Description:** Analyze user behavior patterns over time by grouping users based on shared characteristics or start dates. Track retention, engagement, and lifetime value metrics across cohorts.
- **Triggers:** 
  - \"Run cohort analysis\"
  - \"Analyze user retention by cohort\"
  - \"Show cohort performance over time\"
  - \"Compare cohort behavior\"
  - \"Calculate cohort retention rates\"

## Overview
Cohort analysis segments users into groups (cohorts) based on shared characteristics or time-based criteria (e.g., sign-up date, first purchase month). This skill enables tracking how specific groups behave over time, identifying patterns in retention, engagement, and value.

## Key Capabilities
- **Cohort Definition:** Create cohorts based on time periods (weekly, monthly), user attributes, or behavioral events
- **Retention Analysis:** Calculate how many users from each cohort return over subsequent periods
- **Metric Tracking:** Monitor cohort performance across key metrics (engagement, revenue, conversion)
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare different cohorts to identify trends and anomalies
- **Visualization:** Generate cohort tables/heatmaps showing retention and"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":26,"completion_tokens":250,"total_tokens":276,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":26},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
