## What is User Research?
User research is the systematic study of target users and their needs to inform product design and development. It involves gathering data about user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies. The goal is to create products that are useful, usable, and desirable.

## Practical Framework: The Research Cycle

### 1. **Plan & Define** (20% of effort)
**Beginner Practice:**
- Start with clear research questions (e.g., \"How do users currently solve problem X?\")
- Define who you need to talk to (basic screening criteria)
- Choose one method: 5 user interviews OR a simple survey with <10 questions

**Intermediate Practice:**
- Create a formal research plan with: objectives, methods, timeline, recruitment criteria
- Use mixed methods (e.g., interviews + analytics review)
- Develop a discussion guide with open-ended questions and specific tasks

**Advanced Practice:**
- Align research with business objectives and product roadmap
- Design longitudinal studies or comparative studies
- Establish metrics for success before research begins

### 2. **Recruit & Prepare** (15% of effort)
**Practical Tips:**
- **Internal recruitment:** Use existing user lists, support tickets, or in-app messaging
- **External recruitment:** Use tools like UserInterviews.com or social media screening
- **Incentives:** Offer appropriate compensation ($50-100 for "},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":450,"total_tokens":468,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
