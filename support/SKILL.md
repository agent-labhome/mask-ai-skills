## Purpose
To provide concise, actionable support that addresses core needs without unnecessary detail or elaboration.

## Key Principles

### 1. **Clarity Over Completeness**
- Identify the essential need or problem
- Strip away peripheral information
- Present the core solution or next step

### 2. **Action-Oriented**
- Focus on what can be done now
- Provide specific, executable steps
- Avoid theoretical discussions unless immediately relevant

### 3. **Minimalist Communication**
- Use direct language
- Eliminate filler words and qualifiers
- One clear point per statement

### 4. **Context-Aware**
- Match the recipient's urgency and knowledge level
- Adapt depth to situation (crisis vs. planning)
