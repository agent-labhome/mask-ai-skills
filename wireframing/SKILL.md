## Purpose
A wireframing brief is a foundational document that establishes clear parameters and objectives for creating wireframes. It aligns stakeholders, designers, and developers by defining the project's scope, goals, constraints, and requirements before visual design begins.

## Core Components of an Effective Wireframing Brief

### 1. Project Context & Objectives
- **Business Goals**: What business outcomes should this design support?
- **User Goals**: What problems are users trying to solve?
- **Success Metrics**: How will we measure the wireframe's effectiveness?
- **Project Scope**: What's included/excluded from this wireframing phase?

### 2. Audience & User Needs
- **Primary User Personas**: Who are we designing for?
- **User Scenarios**: Key tasks and workflows users need to accomplish
- **Pain Points**: Current frustrations to address
- **Technical Considerations**: User device preferences, accessibility needs
