# Wireframing

## Overview
Wireframing is the practice of creating simplified visual representations (skeletons) of digital interfaces to establish layout, structure, and functionality before visual design and development begin. Wireframes focus on content hierarchy, user flow, and functionality rather than aesthetics.

## Purpose & Benefits
- **Clarify Requirements**: Translate user needs and business goals into tangible structures
- **Early Validation**: Test and iterate on concepts quickly and inexpensively
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Create shared understanding among designers, developers, and clients
