## Purpose
To rapidly synthesize complex information into a concise, actionable brief that frames innovation opportunities.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Completeness** - Prioritize essential insights over exhaustive detail
2. **Problem-Centric** - Start with the human or business problem, not the solution
3. **Strategic Alignment** - Connect innovation to organizational goals
4. **Action-Oriented** - End with clear next steps and decision points

## Brief Structure (1-2 pages max)

### 1. Opportunity Statement
- What problem are we solving? (1 sentence)
- Why now? (market/tech/customer shifts)
- Strategic importance to organization

### 2. Current Reality
- Customer pain points (observed, not assumed)
- Existing solutions & their gaps
- Key constraints (budget, timeline, regulatory)

### 3. Vision
- Desired future state (concrete outcome)
