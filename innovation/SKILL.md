## Purpose
To rapidly translate complex ideas into actionable, stakeholder-aligned innovation briefs that balance vision with practical execution.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Completeness** – Capture the essence, not every detail
2. **Problem-Led** – Start with the \"why,\" not the \"what\"
3. **Stakeholder-Centric** – Speak the language of your audience
4. **Action-Oriented** – Every section should drive toward decisions

## Essential Framework (The 5C's)

### 1. **Context**
- What problem are we solving? (Frame as user pain or market gap)
- Why now? (Market shifts, tech advances, competitive threats)
- What happens if we do nothing?

### 2. **Core Idea**
- One-sentence concept statement
- Key differentiator (what makes this innovative?)
- Analogies/metaphors for quick understanding
