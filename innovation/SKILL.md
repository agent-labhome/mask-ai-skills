## Overview
An **Innovation Brief** is a strategic document that frames a challenge or opportunity to guide focused, creative problem-solving. It serves as a North Star for innovation teams, providing clear constraints, goals, and context without prescribing the solution. This skill involves both *writing* effective briefs and *using* them to drive ideation and development.

## Core Purpose
To translate a broad business need or opportunity into a clearly defined, actionable challenge that empowers teams to generate novel and valuable solutions.

## Key Components of an Effective Innovation Brief

1.  **Strategic Context:** *Why this matters now.* Links to company vision, market shifts, or user pain points.
2.  **Challenge Statement:** A concise, inspiring question or \"How Might We...\" (HMW) statement that opens the field of exploration.
3.  **Goals & Success Metrics:** Defines what a successful outcome looks like (e.g"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
