# English Skill

## Overview
Quickly check your English level with this brief assessment. Answer 3-5 multiple-choice questions on grammar, vocabulary, or common expressions to receive an instant level estimate (A1-C2).

## How It Works
1. User asks to test their English
2. Skill presents a short series of multiple-choice questions
3. Based on accuracy and question difficulty, provides:
   - Estimated CEFR level (Beginner A1 to Proficient C2)
   - Brief feedback on strengths/areas to improve
   - Option to try another set

## Example Interactions
- "Test my English"
- "Check my English level"
- "How good is my English?"

## Notes
- Assessment is brief and indicative, not comprehensive
- Focuses on practical, everyday English
- Results are educational estimates only"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":173,"total_tokens":187,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache
