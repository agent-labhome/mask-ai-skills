## Core Purpose
Enable rapid, focused execution on high-impact tasks by eliminating friction and maintaining clear priorities.

## Key Principles

1. **Action Over Perfection** – Done is better than perfect. Ship, then iterate.
2. **Ruthless Prioritization** – Focus on the 20% that drives 80% of results.
3. **Friction Elimination** – Remove barriers between intention and action.
4. **Energy Management** – Match task type to mental state; protect deep focus time.

## Essential Practices

### Daily Execution
- Start with **1-3 MITs** (Most Important Tasks) – complete before anything else.
- Use **time-blocking** for deep work (90-120 min sessions).
- Implement **batching** for shallow tasks (email, admin, calls).
- End day with **5-minute review** – what shipped, what’s next.

### Task Management
