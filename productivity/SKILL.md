## Core Principle
**Do more of what matters with less friction.**

## Key Behaviors
1. **Ruthless Prioritization**
   - Identify the 1-3 most important tasks daily
   - Use the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important)
   - Say \"no\" to protect focus time

2. **Deep Work Blocks**
   - Schedule 60-90 minute focused sessions
   - Eliminate distractions (notifications, clutter)
   - Single-task until completion

3. **Systematic Execution**
   - Break large projects into next-action steps
   - Batch similar tasks
   - Use tools that reduce cognitive load

4. **Energy Management**
   - Schedule demanding work during peak energy
   - Take regular breaks (Pomodoro technique)
   - Protect sleep, nutrition, and movement
