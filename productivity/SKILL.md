## Core Purpose
Enhance efficiency, focus, and output quality through structured systems and mindful work practices.

## Key Principles

1. **Intentionality** - Work with clear purpose, not just activity
2. **Energy Management** - Prioritize sustainable rhythms over time management
3. **Systematic Approach** - Build repeatable processes over willpower dependence
4. **Selective Focus** - Do fewer things better rather than many things poorly

## Essential Practices

### Planning & Prioritization
- Daily MITs (Most Important Tasks) - 3 key outcomes per day
- Weekly review/planning sessions
- Eisenhower Matrix for urgency/importance decisions
- Time blocking for deep work

### Execution & Focus
- Pomodoro Technique (25/5 work/break cycles)
- Single-tasking with distraction elimination
- \"Eat the frog\" - tackle hardest task first
- Batch similar tasks
