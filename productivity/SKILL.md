## What is Productivity?
Productivity is the art of accomplishing meaningful work efficiently. It's not about doing more things, but about doing the right things effectively. True productivity balances output with well-being, creating sustainable systems rather than relying on willpower alone.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Intentionality Over Busyness**
- Productivity ≠ constant activity
- Focus on outcomes, not just outputs
- Align tasks with your values and goals

### 2. **Energy Management**
- Recognize your natural rhythms (chronotype)
- Schedule demanding tasks during peak energy
- Include recovery periods

### 3. **System Over Willpower**
- Build habits and systems
- Reduce decision fatigue through routines
- Automate or delegate where possible

## Practical Techniques

### **Time Management**
- **Time Blocking**: Assign specific blocks for different types of work
- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25 minutes focused work, 5-minute break
- **Eisenhower Matrix**: Prioritize by urgency and importance
- **Time Auditing**: Track how you actually spend time for one week
