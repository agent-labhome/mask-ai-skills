## Core Concept
Bootstrapping is the process of starting and growing a venture with minimal external resources, relying primarily on personal finances, revenue reinvestment, and creative resourcefulness.

## Key Principles

**Resourcefulness Over Resources**
- Start with what you have, not what you need
- Convert constraints into creative advantages
- Prioritize cash flow over theoretical scale

**Customer-Funded Growth**
- Generate revenue from day one
- Reinvest profits to fuel expansion
- Validate through paying customers, not investor opinions

**Lean Operations**
- Maintain minimal overhead
- Outsource only when absolutely necessary
- Wear multiple hats until specialization is justified

## Practical Applications

**Financial Discipline**
