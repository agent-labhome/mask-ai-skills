## Overview
Bootstrapping is the practice of starting and growing a business using personal finances and revenue generated by the business, rather than external funding from investors. This approach emphasizes financial discipline, organic growth, and maintaining full control and ownership.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Financial Self-Reliance**
- Start with personal savings or assets
- Reinvest all profits back into the business
- Maintain minimal overhead and fixed costs
- Delay personal compensation until sustainable

### 2. **Revenue-First Mindset**
- Prioritize revenue-generating activities
- Develop minimum viable products (MVPs) that customers will pay for
- Focus on profitability from day one
- Use customer feedback to iterate quickly

### 3. **Resourcefulness & Frugality**
- Leverage free or low-cost tools and platforms
- Barter services when possible
- Outsource only when absolutely necessary
- Embrace DIY solutions for non-core functions
