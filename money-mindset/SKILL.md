A practical framework for developing a healthy, empowered relationship with money. Focuses on beliefs, behaviors, and systems over mere income.

## Core Principles
*   **Money is a Tool:** It's neutral energy to be directed, not a measure of self-worth.
*   **Abundance over Scarcity:** Focus on creation and opportunity, not lack and limitation.
*   **Consciousness is Key:** Awareness of your money story, habits, and emotions is the first step to change.
*   **Action Informs Mindset:** Behavior change often precedes and solidifies belief change.

## Key Practices
1.  **Audit Your Narrative:** Identify limiting beliefs (\"money is evil,\" \"I'm bad with money\").
2.  **Clarify Your \"Why\":** Connect money to your values and life goals (security, freedom, impact).
3.  **Practice Financial Mindfulness:** Track spending without judgment. Know your numbers.
