## Overview
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (\"the cloud\") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. This skill encompasses understanding cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment models (public, private, hybrid), and practical implementation across major cloud platforms.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
**Core Concepts:**
- **Cloud Service Models:**
  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Virtualized computing resources (AWS EC2, Azure VMs)
  - PaaS (Platform as a Service): Development platforms (Heroku, Google App Engine)
  - SaaS (Software as a Service): Applications (Salesforce, Office 365)

- **Deployment Models:**
  - Public Cloud: Services offered over public internet (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - Private Cloud: Dedicated infrastructure for single organization
  - Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private clouds

- **Essential Characteristics:**
  - On-demand self-service
  - Broad network access
  - Resource pooling
  - Rapid elasticity
  - Measured service

**Practical First Steps:**
1. Create free-tier accounts on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform
2. Explore console interfaces and basic navigation
3. Launch your first virtual machine on each platform
4. Understand billing and cost management basics

### Phase 2: Core Services (Months 2-3)
**Compute Services:**
- Virtual Machines and instances
- Container services (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Serverless computing (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- Auto-scaling and load balancing

**Storage Solutions:**
- Object storage (S3, Blob Storage)
- Block storage (EBS, Persistent Disks)
- File storage (EFS, Azure Files)
- Database services (RDS, Cloud SQL,"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":519,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":19},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
