## Overview
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics. It enables organizations to access technology resources without owning and maintaining physical infrastructure.

## Core Concepts

### Service Models
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine)
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Platform for developing, running, and managing applications (e.g., Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Software delivered over the internet (e.g., Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365)

### Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet to multiple organizations
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated cloud infrastructure for a single organization
- **Hybrid Cloud"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
