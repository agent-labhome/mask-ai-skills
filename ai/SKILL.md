# SKILL.md: AI Briefing

## Overview
**AI Briefing** is the skill of creating clear, structured, and actionable briefs for AI systems. It involves translating human goals, constraints, and context into a format that maximizes an AI's effectiveness, efficiency, and alignment with the desired outcome.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity & Specificity
*   **Precision:** Use unambiguous language. Define key terms.
*   **Concreteness:** Prefer specific examples, numbers, and tangible descriptions over vague abstractions.
*   **Scope:** Clearly define the boundaries of the task (what's in, what's out).

### 2. Structure & Organization
*   **Logical Flow:** Present information in an order that aids understanding (e.g., context -> goal -> requirements -> constraints).
*   **Formatting:** Use headings, lists, bullet points, and whitespace to make the brief scannable for both humans and AI.
