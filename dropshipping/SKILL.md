## Overview
Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn't keep products in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party (usually a supplier or manufacturer) and has it shipped directly to the customer. The seller never handles the product directly.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Dropshipping Triangle

 Payment   Profit Margin  Product

         Customer Receives Product
```

### 2. Key Advantages
