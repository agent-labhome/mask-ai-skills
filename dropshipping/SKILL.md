**Core Concept:** Sell products without holding inventory. You handle marketing and sales; suppliers ship directly to customers.

**Key Actions:**
- **Find Products:** Identify trending, niche items with good margins.
- **Choose Suppliers:** Use platforms like AliExpress, Oberlo, or Spocket.
- **Set Up Store:** Create an e-commerce site (Shopify, WooCommerce).
- **Market:** Run ads (Facebook, TikTok), optimize for SEO.
- **Process Orders:** Forward customer orders to your supplier with their details.
- **Customer Service:** Manage inquiries, returns, and tracking.

**Critical Rules:**
- Vet suppliers for reliability and shipping times.
- Be transparent about shipping estimates.
- Price products to cover all fees (platform, payment processing, ads).
- Never use supplier-branded packaging.

**Pros:** Low startup cost, no inventory risk, location-independent.
**Cons:** Low margins, high competition, less control over shipping"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":218,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
