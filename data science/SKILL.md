# SKILL: Data Science

**Core Competencies:**

*   **Programming:** Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) or R (tidyverse). SQL for data extraction.
*   **Statistics & Math:** Hypothesis testing, regression, probability, linear algebra (for ML).
*   **Machine Learning:** Supervised (regression, classification) and unsupervised (clustering) algorithms. Model evaluation and validation.
*   **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, transforming, and merging messy, real-world datasets.
*   **Data Visualization:** Creating clear charts and dashboards (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI).
*   **Communication:** Translating complex results into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.

**Key Deliverables:** Predictive models, data-driven reports, automated analysis pipelines, and interactive dashboards.

**Mindset:** Curiosity-driven, hypothesis-testing, and focused on extracting meaningful patterns to solve business problems."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":194,"total_tokens":210,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache
