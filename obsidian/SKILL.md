## What is Obsidian?
Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base and note-taking application that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. Unlike cloud-based note apps, Obsidian gives you complete ownership and control of your data. Its defining feature is the **graph view**, which visually maps connections between notes, helping you discover relationships in your thinking.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Vaults**
- A vault is simply a folder on your computer containing all your notes and configuration
- You can have multiple vaults for different purposes (work, personal, projects)
- Everything is stored as plain text files (.md), making your data future-proof

### 2. **Linking & Backlinks**
- Create connections between notes using `[[double brackets]]`
- Backlinks automatically show you which notes link to the current note
- This creates a **networked knowledge graph** rather than isolated documents

### 3. **Graph View**
- Visual representation of all connections between notes
- Filter by tags, folders, or unlinked notes
- Helps identify knowledge clusters and gaps

### 4. **Markdown with Extensions**
- Uses standard Markdown with additional features"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":350,"total_tokens":368,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
