## What is Philosophy?

Philosophy (from Greek *philosophia*, \"love of wisdom\") is the systematic study of fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Unlike empirical sciences, philosophy relies primarily on rational argument and critical thinking rather than observation or experimentation.
