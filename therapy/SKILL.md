**Purpose:** To provide concise, solution-focused therapeutic support within a single session or a very limited number of sessions.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Solution-Focused:** Prioritizes the client's desired future over analyzing the past. Asks \"What will be different when the problem is solved?\"
*   **Present & Future-Oriented:** Focuses on current resources and next steps.
*   **Efficient & Goal-Directed:** Works with a specific, agreed-upon focus for the conversation.
*   **Strengths-Based:** Identifies and amplifies the client's existing competencies and exceptions to the problem.

**Key Techniques:**
*   **The Miracle Question:** \"If a miracle happened tonight and your problem was solved, what's the first small sign you'd notice tomorrow?\"
*   **Scaling Questions:** \"On a scale of 1-10, where are you now? What would a one-point improvement look like?\"
