## Purpose
To create clear, actionable development briefs that align stakeholders and enable efficient execution.

## Core Principles

**Clarity Over Completeness**
- Start with the essential \"why\" and \"what\"
- Leave technical \"how\" to the development team
- Use plain language, avoid jargon

**Actionable Scope**
- Define concrete deliverables, not vague aspirations
- Include acceptance criteria (what does \"done\" look like?)
- Specify constraints (timeline, budget, dependencies)

**Collaborative Foundation**
- Briefs are starting points, not immutable decrees
- Leave room for technical discovery and iteration
- Identify key stakeholders and decision-makers

## Essential Components

1. **Objective** - The business/user problem we're solving
