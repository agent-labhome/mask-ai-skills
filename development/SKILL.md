## Purpose
A concise development brief outlines project requirements, scope, and constraints to align stakeholders and guide development.

## Core Components
- **Project Overview**: Clear description of what's being built and why
- **Objectives**: Specific, measurable goals and success criteria
- **Scope**: Included features and explicit exclusions
- **Technical Requirements**: Stack, integrations, performance needs
- **Timeline**: Key milestones and delivery dates
- **Constraints**: Budget, resources, and limitations
- **Success Metrics**: How outcomes will be measured

## Best Practices
- Keep it brief (1-2 pages maximum)
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Define acceptance criteria
- Specify decision-makers and stakeholders
- Include visual references when helpful
- State assumptions explicitly

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Vague requirements without concrete examples
- Unprioritized feature lists
