## Introduction to Investing

Investing is the process of allocating resources (usually money) with the expectation of generating income or profit. Unlike saving (preserving capital) or speculating (gambling on short-term price movements), investing involves careful analysis, time horizon consideration, and risk management to build wealth over the long term.

### Why Invest?
- **Beat Inflation**: Cash loses purchasing power over time (2-3% annually)
- **Build Wealth**: Compound growth multiplies your money
- **Achieve Financial Goals**: Retirement, education, major purchases
- **Generate Passive Income**: Dividends, interest, rental income

## Core Principles

### 1. **Time in the Market vs. Timing the Market**
- **Myth**: You need to buy low and sell high consistently
- **Reality**: Most professional investors fail at market timing
- **Better approach**: Regular contributions (dollar-cost averaging)
- **Data point**: Missing just the 10 best market days over 20 years can cut returns by 50%

### 2. **Risk and Return Relationship**
- Higher potential returns generally come with higher risk
- Your risk tolerance depends on:
  - Time horizon (when you need the money)
  - Financial situation
  - Emotional temperament
  - Specific goals

### 3. **Diversification**
- \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\"
- Spread investments across:
  - Asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities)
  - Industries/ sectors
  - Geographic regions
  - Company sizes (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap)

### 4. **Compound Growth**
- Earnings generate their own earnings over time
- **The Rule of 72**: Divide 72 by your annual return to estimate doubling time
- Example: 8% return = money doubles every 9 years (72"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":518,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
