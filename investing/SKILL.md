## Core Principles
- **Time in market > timing market** – Long-term consistency beats short-term speculation
- **Diversify** – Spread risk across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate)
- **Compound returns** – Reinvest earnings; exponential growth over decades
- **Risk tolerance** – Match investments to your comfort with volatility
- **Costs matter** – Minimize fees (expense ratios, commissions)

## Key Strategies
- **Index investing** – Low-cost ETFs/mutual funds tracking broad markets
- **Dollar-cost averaging** – Invest fixed amounts regularly regardless of price
- **Asset allocation** – Balance portfolio based on goals and timeline
- **Rebalance annually** – Maintain target allocation as markets shift

## Red Flags
- Promises of guaranteed high returns
- Complex products you don’t understand
- High-pressure sales tactics
