## Core Principles
- **Risk Management**: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify.
- **Time Horizon**: Match investments to your goals (short-term vs. long-term).
- **Cost Awareness**: Minimize fees; they compound against your returns.
- **Emotional Discipline**: Avoid panic selling and FOMO buying. Stick to your plan.

## Key Actions
1.  **Define Goals**: (e.g., retirement, house, education).
2.  **Build Foundation**: Emergency fund first, then high-interest debt.
3.  **Asset Allocation**: Split money between stocks (growth), bonds (stability), and cash.
4.  **Choose Vehicles**: Use low-cost index funds/ETFs for broad market exposure.
5.  **Contribute Regularly**: Automate investments (dollar-cost averaging).
6.  **Rebalance Periodically**: Restore your target allocation (e.g., annually).
