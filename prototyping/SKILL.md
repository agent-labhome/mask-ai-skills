## Metadata

**Skill Name:** Prototyping  
**Category:** Design & Development  
**Proficiency Levels:** Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert  
**Related Skills:** User Research, UI/UX Design, Wireframing, User Testing, Design Systems

**Time to Advanced Proficiency:** 6-12 months  
**Tools:** Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, InVision, Framer, ProtoPie, Marvel, Balsamiq  

## Overview

Prototyping is the process of creating interactive models of digital products to test concepts, validate ideas, and communicate design intent before development. It bridges the gap between static designs and functional products, enabling rapid iteration and user-centered design.

## Skill Development Path

### Level 1: Beginner (Weeks 1-4)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the purpose and types of prototypes
- Create basic click-through prototypes
- Learn fundamental prototyping tools

**Key Concepts:**
- **Prototyping Spectrum:** Low-fidelity → High-fidelity
- **Fidelity Levels:** Paper, digital wireframes, interactive mockups
- **Prototyping Goals:** Concept validation, usability testing, stakeholder communication

**Practical Exercises:**
1. **Paper Prototyping:** Sketch 5 screens of a mobile app and simulate user flows
2. **Basic Digital Prototype:** Create a click-through prototype of a 3-screen flow using Figma or Adobe XD
3. **Tool Familiarization:** Complete introductory tutorials for your chosen prototyping tool

**Resources:**
- Nielsen Norman Group: \"Paper Prototyping\"
- Figma Learn: Prototyping Basics
- \"The Design of Everyday Things\" by Don Norman (relevant chapters)

### Level 2: Intermediate (Months 2-6)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Create medium-fidelity interactive prototypes
- Implement basic animations and transitions
- Conduct simple usability tests with prototypes

**Key Concepts:**
- **Interaction Design:** States, triggers, and actions
- **Animation Principles:** Easing, duration, purpose-driven motion
- **Prototyping for Testing:** Creating testable scenarios and tasks

**Practical Exercises:**
1. **Interactive Flow:** Build a complete user flow (8-10 screens) with multiple navigation paths
2. **Animation Practice:** Implement 5 different transition types (fade, slide, push, scale, overlay"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":519,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":19},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
