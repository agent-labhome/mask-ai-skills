# SKILL.md: Prototyping Brief

## Core Competency
Rapidly translating concepts into tangible, testable artifacts to validate assumptions, gather feedback, and guide development.

## Key Principles

### 1. Purpose-Driven Prototyping
- **Clarity of Goal**: Every prototype must answer a specific question (e.g., "Will users understand this flow?" "Is this interaction intuitive?").
- **Right-Fidelity**: Match prototype complexity to the question being answered (paper sketch â concept validation, interactive digital â usability).
- **Learn, Don't Just Build**: The value is in the insights gained, not the artifact itself.

### 2. Speed & Iteration
- **Bias for Action**: Create the simplest thing that can test the hypothesis.
- **Embrace "Good Enough"**: Avoid over-polishing early-stage prototypes.
- **Rapid Cycles**: Build â Test â Learn â Adjust. Multiple quick loops beat one perfect prototype.
