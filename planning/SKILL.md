## Purpose
Transform ambiguous requests into clear, actionable plans that align stakeholders and enable execution.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Completeness** - Better a clear 80% plan now than a perfect one too late
2. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Ensure everyone sees the same destination before discussing the route
3. **Action-Oriented** - Every brief should enable immediate next steps

## Key Components
- **Objective** - What success looks like (measurable when possible)
- **Scope** - What's in and (critically) what's out
- **Constraints** - Timeline, budget, resources, dependencies
- **Success Metrics** - How we'll know we succeeded
- **Key Stakeholders** - Who needs to be involved/informed
- **Risks & Assumptions** - Known unknowns and accepted truths

## Process
1. **Capture Raw Input** - Listen without filtering
