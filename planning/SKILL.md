## Purpose
Transform ambiguous requests into clear, actionable plans by asking strategic questions that uncover hidden requirements and constraints.

## Core Method: The 5-Wheel Framework

Ask these five categories of questions before starting any project:

### 1. **WHY** - Purpose & Impact
- \"What problem are we solving?\"
- \"What happens if we don't do this?\"
- \"How will we measure success?\"
- \"Who benefits from this?\"

### 2. **WHAT** - Scope & Deliverables
- \"What does 'done' look like?\"
- \"What's explicitly out of scope?\"
- \"What are the must-have vs. nice-to-have features?\"
- \"What format should the final deliverable take?\"

### 3. **WHO** - Stakeholders & Resources
- \"Who needs to be involved/consulted?\"
- \"Who approves the final deliverable?\"
- \"Who will maintain/support this afterward?\"
