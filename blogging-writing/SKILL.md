## Core Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness** – Write for the reader, not for yourself.
- **Value-first** – Every post must solve a problem, answer a question, or provide unique insight.
- **Scannable structure** – Use headings, short paragraphs, bullet points, and bold text.
- **Strong opening** – Hook the reader in the first sentence.
- **Actionable conclusion** – End with a clear takeaway or next step.

## Quick Checklist
