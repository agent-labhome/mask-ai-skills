## Core Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness** – Write for the reader, not for yourself.
- **Value-first** – Every post must solve a problem, answer a question, or provide unique insight.
- **Scannable structure** – Use headings, short paragraphs, bullet points, and bold text.
- **Strong opening** – Hook the reader in the first sentence.
- **Actionable conclusion** – End with a clear takeaway or next step.

## Quick Process
1.  **Identify** a specific reader and their single burning question.
2.  **Outline** the key points before writing a single sentence.
3.  **Draft** quickly without self-editing.
4.  **Edit** ruthlessly for clarity, conciseness, and flow.
5.  **Optimize** with one clear keyword, a meta description, and a compelling title.

## Avoid
- Jargon without explanation.
