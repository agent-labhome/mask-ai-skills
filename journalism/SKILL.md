## Core Purpose
To systematically gather, verify, and communicate information of public interest in a clear, accurate, and compelling manner.

## Key Principles
1.  **Accuracy & Verification:** Fact-checking is non-negotiable. Every claim, name, date, and statistic must be verified from multiple, reliable sources.
2.  **Objectivity & Fairness:** Strive to present information without bias, representing all relevant perspectives fairly and in proper context.
3.  **Clarity & Brevity:** Communicate complex information in a way that is easily understood by a general audience. Avoid jargon.
4.  **Public Interest:** Focus on information that matters to the community, holds power to account, or helps people make informed decisions.
5.  **Ethical Conduct:** Adhere to principles of integrity, minimize harm, act independently, and be accountable and transparent.
