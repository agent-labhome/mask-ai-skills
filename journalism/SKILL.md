## Detailed Guide to Journalism

### 1. Foundational Principles & Ethics
Journalism is built on a social contract with the public. Before mastering techniques, internalize its core purpose and ethical framework.

**The \"Why\":**
- **Watchdog Function:** Holding power (government, corporate, institutional) accountable.
- **Informed Citizenry:** Providing the information necessary for a democratic society to function.
- **Public Forum:** Facilitating conversation on issues of public importance.
- **Chronicler of Record:** Documenting events, trends, and culture for history.

**Core Ethical Pillars (SPJ Code of Ethics):**
- **Seek Truth and Report It:** Accuracy is paramount. Verify, verify, verify. Identify sources clearly. Provide context. Never plagiarize.
- **Minimize Harm:** Treat sources, subjects, colleagues, and the public with respect. Balance the public's need for information against potential harm. Show compassion.
- **Act Independently:** Avoid conflicts of interest (real or perceived). Refuse gifts/favors. Be wary of sources offering information for favors.
- **Be Accountable and Transparent:** Acknowledge and correct mistakes promptly. Explain ethical choices to the public. Expose unethical conduct in journalism.

### 2. The Journalistic Process: From Idea to Publication
