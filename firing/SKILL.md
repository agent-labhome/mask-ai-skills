## CORE PRINCIPLE
**Move fast, cut deep, act decisively.**  
Firing is not failure—it’s strategic pruning. When someone is a poor fit, keeping them hurts the team, the company, and the individual.

## WHEN TO FIRE
- **Values misalignment** → Immediate risk.
- **Performance issues** → After clear feedback and no improvement.
- **Team toxicity** → Zero tolerance.
- **Role redundancy** → Business necessity.

## HOW TO FIRE
1. **Prepare**  
   - Have HR/legal review.  
   - Finalize logistics (access, final pay, belongings).  
   - Script key points.

2. **The Meeting**  
   - Be direct, clear, and brief (<10 minutes).  
   - State the decision upfront.  
   - No debate, no apologies for the decision.  
   - Explain logistics only.

3. **After**
