# Morning Routine SKILL

## Purpose
Establish a consistent, energizing start to your day in under 30 minutes.

## Core Sequence
1. **Hydrate** (2 min) - Drink a glass of water
2. **Move** (5 min) - Light stretching or a quick walk
3. **Focus** (3 min) - Set 1-3 priorities for the day
4. **Prepare** (5 min) - Tidy one small area or prep for your first task

## Key Principles
- **Consistency > Perfection:** Doing something is better than an ideal routine you skip.
- **Device Delay:** Avoid phones/email for the first 15 minutes.
- **Anchor Habit:** Attach your routine to a fixed trigger (e.g., after brushing teeth).

## Quick Start
Pick **one** action from the Core Sequence and do it tomorrow morning.
