## Overview
Customer service is the practice of providing assistance, support, and value to customers before, during, and after a purchase or interaction. It encompasses communication skills, problem-solving, empathy, and technical knowledge to create positive experiences that build loyalty and satisfaction.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Customer-Centric Mindset**
- View every interaction through the customer's perspective
- Prioritize customer needs alongside business objectives
- Recognize that customer experience directly impacts business success

### 2. **The Service Triangle**
```
         Company
          /   \
    Product --- Customer
```
- Balance company policies, product capabilities, and customer needs
- Serve as the bridge between organizational goals and customer satisfaction

### 3. **Moments of Truth**
Every customer interaction is a \"moment of truth\" that shapes their perception of your organization. Excellence in these moments builds loyalty; failure damages reputation.
