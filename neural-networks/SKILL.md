# SKILL.md: Neural Networks

## Core Competency
Understanding, implementing, and applying artificial neural networks for pattern recognition, prediction, and decision-making tasks.

## Proficiency Levels

### Level 1: Foundational
- Understands basic neuron structure (inputs, weights, activation, output)
- Can explain forward propagation in simple networks
- Knows common activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
- Understands the concept of loss functions (MSE, cross-entropy)
- Can implement a simple feedforward network using a framework (TensorFlow/PyTorch)

### Level 2: Intermediate
- Implements backpropagation from scratch for small networks
- Understands and applies regularization techniques (L1/L2, dropout)
- Can tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, layers)
- Works with different architectures (CNNs for images, RNNs for sequences)
- Knows optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop)
