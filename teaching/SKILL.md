## Core Principles
- **Clarity First**: Simplify complex concepts into digestible parts
- **Active Engagement**: Prioritize participation over passive listening
- **Iterative Feedback**: Build in regular checkpoints for adjustment
- **Scaffolded Learning**: Connect new knowledge to existing understanding

## Key Techniques
- **Chunking**: Break information into 7±2 unit segments
- **Spaced Repetition**: Reinforce concepts at increasing intervals
- **Metacognition**: Teach students how to monitor their own learning
- **Differentiation**: Adapt methods for varied learning styles

## Quick Wins
- Start sessions with clear objectives
- Use \"think-pair-share\" for instant engagement
- End with concrete takeaways
- Provide multiple pathways to demonstrate understanding

## Avoid
- Information overload in single sessions
- Assuming one explanation fits all
- Neglecting to check for understanding
- Teaching content without context
