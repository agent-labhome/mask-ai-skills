## Purpose
Communicate clearly and concisely in written form.

## Key Principles
- **Brevity**: Express ideas in the fewest words possible without losing meaning
- **Clarity**: Use precise language that leaves no room for misinterpretation
- **Directness**: Get to the point quickly; avoid unnecessary preamble
- **Active Voice**: Prefer \"The team completed the project\" over \"The project was completed by the team\"

## Application
- Emails: Subject line summarizes content; opening states purpose
- Documentation: Concise explanations with clear examples
- Meetings: Prepare talking points; speak when you add value
- Reports: Lead with conclusions; support with essential data only

## Avoid
- Redundant phrases (\"advance planning,\" \"end result\")
- Jargon without explanation
- Qualifiers that weaken statements (\"I think,\" \"maybe\")
- Unnecessary adjectives and adverbs
