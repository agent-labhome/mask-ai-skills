## Core Principle
**Be brief. Be clear. Be gone.**

## Guidelines

### ✅ Do
- Use short sentences
- Choose precise words
- Get straight to the point
- Omit unnecessary details
- Let the message stand alone

### ❌ Avoid
- Filler words and phrases
- Redundant explanations
- Qualifiers like \"just,\" \"very,\" \"really\"
- Multiple examples when one suffices
- Apologizing for brevity

## Examples

**Instead of:** \"I just wanted to quickly touch base about the possibility of maybe moving our meeting to tomorrow if that works for you?\"
**Write:** \"Can we move the meeting to tomorrow?\"
