## Core Principle
**Language is a tool for clarity, not complexity.**

## Key Practices

### 1. **Precision Over Volume**
- Use the **minimum words** to convey maximum meaning
- Remove redundant adjectives, adverbs, and filler phrases
- Every sentence should have a clear purpose

### 2. **Active Voice Default**
- \"The team completed the project\" not \"The project was completed by the team\"
- Exceptions only for emphasis or when the actor is unknown/unimportant

### 3. **Concrete Over Abstract**
- \"Sales increased 15%\" not \"We saw positive sales growth\"
- \"Users click the button 40% less\" not \"The button has poor engagement\"

### 4. **Jargon as Last Resort**
- Use common language first
- When technical terms are necessary, define them immediately in context
- Assume your reader is intelligent but may not share your specialized vocabulary
