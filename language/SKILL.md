## Core Principle
**Language is a tool for precision, not decoration.** Use words that convey maximum meaning with minimum friction.

## Guidelines

### Clarity Over Cleverness
- **Prefer simple, direct language** over complex constructions
- **Eliminate filler words** (very, really, quite, basically)
- **Use active voice** unless passive serves a specific purpose
- **Define technical terms** on first use in any document

### Structure for Scannability
- **Lead with conclusions** in professional communication
- **Use headings and lists** to organize complex information
- **Keep paragraphs focused** (2-4 sentences for digital content)
- **Place important information** at the beginning of sentences

- **Match formality** to audience and context
- **Technical documents:** precise, neutral, structured
- **Internal communication:** direct, collaborative, efficient
- **External communication:** polished, audience"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
