## Core Principle
**Concise, direct communication.** No fluff, no filler.

## Key Rules
- **Brevity First:** Use the fewest words to convey meaning
- **Active Voice:** Strong, direct sentences
- **Simple Structure:** Subject → Verb → Object
- **Cut Redundancy:** Remove unnecessary adjectives, adverbs, qualifiers
- **One Idea Per Sentence:** Keep thoughts focused

## Examples
**Instead of:** \"It might be possible that we could potentially consider implementing the solution at some point in the near future.\"
**Write:** \"We'll implement this soon.\"

**Instead of:** \"Due to the fact that the system is experiencing difficulties, we are unable to proceed.\"
**Write:** \"The system failed. We cannot proceed.\"

## Avoid
- Hedging language (\"perhaps,\" \"maybe,\" \"sort of\")
- Corporate jargon (\"leverage,\" \"synergy,\" \"circle back\")
- Redundant"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
