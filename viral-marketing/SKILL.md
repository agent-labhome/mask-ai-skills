## Purpose
Transform marketing campaigns into self-propagating phenomena by leveraging network effects, social dynamics, and shareable content mechanics.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Contagious Content Design**
- **Emotional Resonance**: Content must trigger high-arousal emotions (awe, excitement, amusement, anger)
- **Practical Value**: Information that solves problems or improves lives gets shared
- **Social Currency**: Content that makes sharers look knowledgeable, connected, or compassionate
- **Public Visibility**: Observable behaviors are more likely to be imitated (social proof principle)

### 2. **Network Architecture**
- **Influencer Mapping**: Identify connectors, mavens, and salespeople within target networks
- **Seed Strategy**: Strategic initial distribution to maximize spread velocity
- **Platform Optimization**: Tailor content for specific platform sharing mechanics
- **Cross-Platform Migration**: Design content to flow naturally between platforms
