## Overview
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products. This skill encompasses designing, deploying, and managing applications and infrastructure on GCP.

## Core Competency Framework

### Level 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
**Technical Skills:**
- **Cloud Fundamentals:**
  - Understanding IaaS, PaaS, SaaS models
  - GCP global infrastructure (regions, zones, network tiers)
  - Resource hierarchy (Organization → Folders → Projects → Resources)
  - Billing and cost management basics

- **Core Services:**
  - Compute Engine (VMs, instance groups, images)
  - Cloud Storage (buckets, storage classes, lifecycle policies)
  - Cloud IAM (roles, permissions, service accounts)
  - VPC Networking (VPCs, subnets, firewall rules, Cloud NAT)
  - Cloud SQL (managed MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)

- **Basic Operations:**
  - Using Cloud Console and Cloud Shell
  - Basic gcloud CLI commands
  - Simple deployments via Console
  - Monitoring with Cloud Monitoring basics

**Practical Projects:**
