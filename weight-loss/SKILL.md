## 功能

## Core Principles
- **Calorie Deficit**: Consume fewer calories than you burn.
- **Sustainable Habits**: Focus on lifestyle changes, not quick fixes.
- **Consistency Over Perfection**: Small, daily actions yield long-term results.

## Key Actions
1.  **Nutrition**: Prioritize whole foods (vegetables, lean protein, fiber). Control portions and limit processed foods/sugary drinks.
2.  **Movement**: Aim for 150+ minutes of moderate exercise weekly. Include strength training 2x/week to preserve muscle.
3.  **Hydration**: Drink water throughout the day, especially before meals.
4.  **Sleep & Stress**: Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep and manage stress to support hormonal balance.

## Mindset
- Track progress with metrics beyond the scale (energy, clothing fit).
- Plan for setbacks; one off-day doesn't ruin progress.
- Seek support when needed (community,"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":216,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache
