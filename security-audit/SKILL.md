# Security Audit SKILL

## Metadata
- **Category**: Security & Compliance
- **Complexity**: Advanced
- **Time Required**: 2-8 hours (depending on scope)
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Basic understanding of security principles
  - Access to systems/application being audited
  - Relevant compliance frameworks (if applicable)
- **Output**: Security audit report with findings and recommendations

## Overview
A systematic evaluation of security controls, policies, and procedures to identify vulnerabilities, assess compliance, and recommend improvements.

## Practical Guide

### Phase 1: Preparation & Scoping (1-2 hours)

**Define Audit Scope:**
- [ ] Identify systems, applications, or processes to audit
- [ ] Determine audit objectives (compliance, risk assessment, etc.)
- [ ] Select relevant security frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST, CIS, etc.)
- [ ] Document audit boundaries and limitations

**Gather Documentation:**
- [ ] Security policies and procedures
- [ ] Network diagrams and architecture documents
- [ ] Previous audit reports
- [ ] Incident response plans
- [ ] Access control lists and user permissions

### Phase 2: Technical Assessment (3-4 hours)

**Network Security:**
- [ ] Review firewall configurations and rules
- [ ] Check for open ports and unnecessary services
- [ ] Verify network segmentation
- [ ] Test VPN and remote access security
- [ ] Scan for vulnerabilities using tools (Nessus, OpenVAS)

**System Security:**
- [ ] Review operating system hardening
- [ ] Check patch management processes
- [ ] Verify antivirus/anti-malware deployment
- [ ] Audit user accounts and privileges
- [ ] Review logging and monitoring configurations

**Application Security:**
- [ ] Test for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] Check input validation and output encoding
- [ ] Assess session management
- [ ] Review error handling and logging

**Data Security:**
- [ ] Verify encryption in transit and at rest
- [ ] Check data classification and handling procedures
- [ ] Review backup and recovery processes"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":450,"total_tokens":468,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
