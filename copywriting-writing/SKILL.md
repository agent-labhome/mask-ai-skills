## Purpose
To create clear, actionable briefs that align stakeholders, guide creative work, and ensure efficient, on-brand copy development.

## Core Principles

1.  **Clarity Over Everything:** Eliminate ambiguity. Every team member should interpret the brief the same way.
2.  **Strategic Foundation:** Connect every ask to a business goal and user need.
3.  **Succinct & Scannable:** Be comprehensive, not long-winded. Use bullet points and clear headers.

## Brief Structure (The \"5 Ws & H\")

A strong brief answers these questions:

*   **Why? (Objective & Goal)**
    *   What specific business or user problem are we solving?
    *   What is the single most important thing this copy must achieve? (e.g., \"Increase sign-ups by 15%,\" \"Reduce support queries about feature X\").

*   **Who? (Audience)**
