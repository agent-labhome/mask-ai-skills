## Overview
A **Culture Brief** is a strategic document that captures the essence of an organization's or team's culture. It serves as a clear, actionable guide that defines values, behaviors, norms, and the desired environment. Unlike a generic mission statement, a Culture Brief is a practical tool used for alignment, hiring, onboarding, and decision-making.

## Purpose & Why It Matters
- **Alignment:** Ensures everyone is working towards the same cultural goals.
- **Decision Filter:** Provides a framework for making values-aligned choices.
- **Talent Magnet & Filter:** Attracts people who thrive in your culture and repels mismatches.
