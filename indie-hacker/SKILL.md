## What is an Indie Hacker?
An indie hacker is an entrepreneur who builds and grows internet businesses independently or with a small team, typically prioritizing profitability and sustainability over rapid scaling and venture capital. The focus is on creating value, solving real problems, and achieving financial freedom through digital products, services, or content.

## Core Principles
1. **Profit First:** Build businesses that generate revenue from day one (or as soon as possible).
2. **Lean Operation:** Keep costs minimal and automate/outsource where possible.
3. **Direct Connection:** Build a direct relationship with your audience and customers.
4. **Iterative Building:** Launch small, learn fast, and improve based on feedback.
5. **Own Your Time:** Design businesses that provide autonomy and lifestyle flexibility.

## Practical Guide: The Indie Hacker Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Objective:** Set your mindset and choose a viable starting point.

1. **Mindset Shift:**
   - Embrace the \"maker\" mentality: you create things that solve problems.
   - Accept that failure is data, not defeat. Pivot is a strategy.
   - Define your \"why\": Financial independence? Creative freedom? Solving a specific problem?

2. **Idea Generation & Validation:**
   - **Find Problems:** Look for frustrations in your own life, online communities (Reddit, Twitter, niche forums), or existing products with poor reviews.
   - **Validate Quickly:** Before building, ask: \"Would you pay for this?\" Use tools like:
     - **Problem Interviews:** Talk to 5-10 potential users.
     - **Landing Page Test:** Build a simple landing page (with Carrd, Gumroad) describing the solution and collect email sign-ups.
     - **Pre-sales:** Sell the concept before it's built (e.g., via a waitlist with a discount).

3. **Skill Audit:**
