## Core Principles
- **Authenticity is key:** Be genuine, transparent, and add value. Never use a purely sales tone.
- **Subreddit-first:** Respect each community's unique culture, rules, and norms. Read the rules before posting.
- **Lurk before you leap:** Understand the community dynamics before participating.

## Key Tactics
1. **Target relevant subreddits** (e.g., r/yourindustry, r/askreddit, r/ama for AMAs).
2. **Engage as a user first,** contributor second. Answer questions, provide helpful advice.
3. **Use Reddit's native formats:** AMAs, thoughtful text posts, image posts (if allowed), and comments.
4. **Disclose affiliations** transparently if sharing your own content/product.
