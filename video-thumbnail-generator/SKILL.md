# Video Thumbnail Generator

Create high-converting YouTube thumbnails that grab attention and drive clicks.

## Quick Start

### Core Principles

1. **Face emotion sells** - Thumbnails with expressive human faces get 38% more clicks
2. **High contrast colors** - Use bold, saturated colors that stand out
3. **Big text minimal** - 3-5 words max, readable at tiny sizes
4. **Arrow/eye direction** - Point toward your face or title
5. **Curiosity gap** - Create questions the viewer wants answered

### Thumbnail Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [EMOTIONAL FACE]   [BIG TEXT] │
│  ← Pointing arrow →            │
│  [Secondary context]           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Creating Thumbnails

### Step 1: Analyze the Video Content

Extract key themes:
- What is the video about?
- What's the main value proposition?
- Who is the target audience?
- What emotion should the viewer feel?

### Step 2: Generate Concepts

Create 3-5 thumbnail concepts:

**Concept Format:**
```
Title: [Catchy headline]
Layout: [Where elements are placed]
Colors: [Primary + accent colors]
Emotion: [What face expression to show]
Text: [Text to include]
Hook: [What makes someone click]
```

### Step 3: Text Formulas

Effective thumbnail text patterns:

| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| How-to | "How to X in Y Minutes" | Tutorials |
| Listicle | "X Ways to X" | Tips & tricks |
| Secret | "The X Nobody Tells You" | Exclusive info |
| Before/After | "Before X → After X" | Transformations |
| Mistake | "Stop Doing X Wrong" | Corrections |
| Ultimate | "The Complete Guide to X" | Comprehensive |

### Step 4: Color Palettes

High-performing color combinations:

- **Red + White**: Urgency, excitement (gaming, drama)
- **Blue + Yellow**: Trust + energy (tech, education)
- **Green + Black**: Money, success (finance, business)
- **Pink + Purple**: Fun, lifestyle (entertainment)
- **Orange + White**: Action, deals (sales, coupons)

### Step 5: Face Guidelines

For emotional faces:
- Exaggerate expressions (shock, joy, concern)
- Shoot from slightly below (power angle)
- Use dramatic lighting
- Show teeth for positive, frown for serious
