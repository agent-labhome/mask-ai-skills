## Objective
Win points by hitting the ball into the opponent's court so they cannot return it legally. Win enough points to win games, sets, and ultimately the match.

## Core Rules
- **Scoring**: Love (0), 15, 30, 40, Game. If tied at 40-40, it's \"Deuce.\" A player must win two consecutive points from Deuce to win the game.
- **Serving**: Serve diagonally from behind the baseline into the opponent's service box. Two attempts per point. The serve alternates sides each point and switches players every game.
- **Playing a Point**: The ball must bounce once on each side initially, then can be volleyed (hit before it bounces). It must land within the singles or doubles boundaries.
- **Boundaries**: Use the inner sidelines for singles, the outer sidelines for doubles. The baseline and service lines mark the back and service box boundaries"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
