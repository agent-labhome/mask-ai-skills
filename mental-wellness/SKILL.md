## Overview
Mental wellness is the practice of maintaining and improving psychological health through intentional habits and mindsets. This skill encompasses emotional regulation, stress management, self-awareness, and resilience building. Unlike crisis intervention, mental wellness focuses on proactive maintenance of mental health.

## Core Principles
1. **Holistic Approach:** Mental wellness integrates emotional, psychological, and social well-being
2. **Preventative Focus:** Emphasizes daily practices over crisis management
3. **Individualized:** What works varies by person—experimentation is key
4. **Non-linear Progress:** Accepting ups and downs as part of the process
