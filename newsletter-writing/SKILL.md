# Newsletter Writing Skill

## Overview
Newsletter writing is the skill of creating regular email communications that provide value to subscribers while achieving organizational goals. Effective newsletters build relationships, establish authority, and drive engagement rather than just broadcasting information.

## Core Principles

### 1. Value-First Mindset
- Every newsletter should provide clear value to the reader
- Balance promotional content with educational/entertaining material
- Follow the 80/20 rule: 80% value, 20% promotion

### 2. Audience-Centric Approach
- Write for a specific person (create reader personas)
- Address reader pain points and aspirations
