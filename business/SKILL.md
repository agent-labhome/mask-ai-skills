## Purpose
To distill complex business information into concise, actionable summaries for decision-makers.

## Core Principles

**Clarity Over Completeness**
- Lead with the single most important point
- Use plain language, avoid jargon
- Answer \"So what?\" immediately

**Structure for Speed**
- Situation → Problem → Solution → Next Steps
- One idea per paragraph
- Bullet points for lists, not paragraphs

**Audience Awareness**
- Executive: Focus on impact and decisions
- Team: Emphasize actions and ownership
- Client: Highlight value and alignment

## Key Components

1. **Headline**: One-line summary of the entire brief
