## Brief
Football (soccer) is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The objective is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal, primarily using the feet, but players may also use any other part of their body except their hands and arms (with the exception of the goalkeeper within their own penalty area). It is governed by a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game.
