*   **Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
