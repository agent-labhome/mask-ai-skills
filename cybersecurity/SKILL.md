## Practical Skill Development Path

### 1. Foundational Knowledge (0-6 months)
**Core Concepts:**
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Common attack vectors (phishing, malware, DDoS, insider threats)
- Basic networking (TCP/IP, OSI model, ports/protocols)
- Operating system fundamentals (Windows/Linux security basics)

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Set up a home lab using VirtualBox/VMware
- Perform basic network scanning with `nmap`
- Analyze packet captures with Wireshark
- Use `iptables` for basic firewall configuration
- Complete beginner CTF challenges (TryHackMe, OverTheWire)

### 2. Defensive Operations (6-18 months)
**Core Concepts:**
- Security monitoring and log analysis
- Vulnerability management lifecycle
- Incident response procedures
- Security controls and hardening benchmarks (CIS)

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Deploy and configure a SIEM (Splunk Free/ELK Stack)
- Set up intrusion detection with Snort/Suric"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":450,"total_tokens":467,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":17},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
