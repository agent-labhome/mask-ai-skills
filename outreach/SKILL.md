## Overview
A structured framework for creating effective outreach briefs that align teams, clarify objectives, and ensure consistent execution across channels.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity Over Completeness**: Prioritize clear, actionable information over exhaustive detail
- **Audience-Centric**: Every element should connect back to the target audience
- **Channel-Agnostic Structure**: Framework works for email, social, events, partnerships, etc.
- **Collaborative By Design**: Briefs should facilitate team alignment, not just document decisions
