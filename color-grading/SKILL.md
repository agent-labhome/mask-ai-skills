# SKILL: Color Grading

## Core Purpose
Adjust color, contrast, and tone to shape the visual mood, continuity, and storytelling of an image or video.

## Key Principles
* **Continuity:** Ensure consistent look across all shots in a sequence.
* **Intentionality:** Every adjustment serves the story or emotion.
* **Balance:** Achieve pleasing skin tones and naturalistic color (unless stylized).
* **Control:** Work non-destructively using layers, masks, and secondary corrections.

## Primary Tools & Techniques
* **Primary Correction:** Global adjustments using Lift/Gamma/Gain, contrast, saturation.
* **Log/RAW Processing:** Properly interpreting flat footage for maximum flexibility.
* **Curves:** Precise control over luma and individual color channels.
* **Qualifiers (Power Windows/Masks):** Isolating and adjusting specific colors or areas.
* **Scopes:** Using waveforms, vectorscopes, and histograms for objective analysis"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":217,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":17},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache
