## Overview
Writing is the craft of organizing thought into structured text to communicate effectively, persuade, inform, or entertain. It transcends mere grammar—it's thinking made visible, shaped for an audience and purpose.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Every sentence should have one clear point
- Use precise language; avoid ambiguity
- If you can remove a word without losing meaning, remove it

### 2. **Reader-Centric Mindset**
- Write for your reader's knowledge level
- Anticipate questions and address them
- Respect reader's time and attention

### 3. **Structure Creates Understanding**
- Ideas need logical progression
- Transitions guide readers between thoughts
- Hierarchy (headings, paragraphs) organizes complexity

### 4. **Voice Emerges From Authenticity**
- Don't \"create\" a voice; let it emerge from honest expression
- Consistency in tone builds trust
- Adapt voice to purpose and audience

## The Writing Process Framework

### Phase 1: Pre-Writing (30% of effort)
**Purpose:** Clarify thinking before writing sentences

**Techniques:**
- **Audience Analysis:** Who are they? What do they know? What do they need?
- **Purpose Definition:** Inform? Persuade? Entertain? Inspire action?
- **Brainstorming:** Mind maps, lists, free-writing (no editing)
- **Research:** Gather facts, quotes, data, examples
- **Outline:** Create skeleton structure (I. A. 1. a. or bullet hierarchy)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Can I state my main point in one sentence?
- [ ] Do I know what my reader should feel/do after reading?
- [ ] Have I gathered sufficient supporting material?
- [ ] Does my structure flow logically?

### Phase 2: Drafting (20% of"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":518,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
