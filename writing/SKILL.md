## Core Principle
**Conciseness with clarity** – delivering complete information in the fewest words possible without sacrificing understanding.

## Key Techniques

### 1. **Start with the Bottom Line**
- Lead with the main point or conclusion
- Answer \"What does the reader need to know?\" first
- Example: Instead of building up to it, state: \"We need to postpone the launch by two weeks.\"

### 2. **Apply the \"So What?\" Test**
- For every sentence, ask: \"Does this add necessary value?\"
- Remove explanations that don't change understanding
- Eliminate redundant adjectives and adverbs

### 3. **Use the Inverted Pyramid**
- Most important information → Supporting details → Background/context
- Allows readers to stop at any point with core understanding

### 4. **Implement Sentence-Level Editing**
- Replace phrases with single words (\"due to the fact that\" → \"because\")
