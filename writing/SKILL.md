## Core Competency
The ability to distill complex information into concise, actionable, and audience-focused documents that drive clear decisions and outcomes.

## Key Principles
1.  **Clarity Over Comprehensiveness:** Prioritize the essential message. Omit unnecessary detail.
2.  **Audience-Centric:** Tailor language, tone, and depth to the reader's needs and knowledge level.
3.  **Action-Oriented:** Every brief should lead to a clear decision, action, or understanding.
4.  **Structured for Scannability:** Use formatting (headings, bullets, whitespace) to guide the reader quickly to key points.

## Essential Structure (The Brief Brief)
A high-impact brief typically includes these elements, often in this order:

1.  **Header:** To | From | Date | Subject (The \"TL;DR\" of the brief)
2.  **Purpose/Objective (1-2 sentences):** Why"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
