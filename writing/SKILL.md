**Core Principle:** Value the reader's time. Every word must earn its place.

### Key Rules

*   **Start with the point.** Lead with the conclusion or main request.
*   **Cut relentlessly.** Remove filler words, redundant phrases, and unnecessary context.
*   **Use simple words.** Choose \"use\" over \"utilize,\" \"start\" over \"commence.\"
*   **Prefer short sentences.** One idea per sentence.
*   **Be specific.** \"Send the report by 3 PM\" is better than \"Send it soon.\"
*   **Use formatting.** Bullet points, bold key terms, and clear headings aid quick scanning.

### Before & After
