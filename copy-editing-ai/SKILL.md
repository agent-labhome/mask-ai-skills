### Editing Frameworks

**1. The AI Editing Pipeline:**

```
Raw Draft → AI Grammar Check → AI Clarity → Tone Adjust → Final Polish
```

**2. Prompt Templates:**

**For Professional Tone:**
```
Edit this text to be more professional and business-appropriate:
[INSERT TEXT]
Maintain the original meaning but improve clarity and formality.
```

**For Conversational Style:**
```
Rewrite this in a friendly, conversational tone:
[INSERT TEXT]
Make it sound natural, like talking to a friend.
```

**For Persuasive Copy:**
```
Enhance this text to be more persuasive:
[INSERT TEXT]
Use power words, urgency, and clear CTAs.
```

### Content-Type Specific

**Email Editing:**
- Subject lines: 50 chars max, curiosity + value
- Body: 3-5 sentences, scannable format
- CTA: Clear, specific action

**Before → After Example:**
```
Before: "Hey, I was wondering if you might be able to meet 
sometime next week to discuss the project?"

After: "Hi [Name], Could we schedule a 30-minute call next 
Tuesday at 2pm to discuss the project? I have some ideas 
I'd like to share that could help us hit our Q3 goals."
```

**Marketing Copy:**
- Headline: Benefit-driven, specific
- Body: Problem-Agitation-Solution
- CTA: Action-oriented, low friction

**SEO Optimization:**
```
Prompt: Optimize this for [keyword]:
[INSERT CONTENT]

Include:
- Primary keyword in H1/title
- Secondary keywords in subheadings
- Natural keyword density (1-2%)
- Meta description (150-160 chars)
```

### Tone Guidelines

| Tone | Use When | Avoid |
|------|----------|-------|
| Professional | B2B, formal | Slang, humor |
| Friendly | B2C, informal | Jargon |
| Authoritative | Thought leadership | Hedging |
| Conversational | Social, email | Complex sentences |
| Urgent | Sales, deadlines | Passive voice |

### Batch Editing Workflow

**For Content Teams:**
```
1. Writer creates draft in Google Doc
2. AI tool (Grammarly Business) reviews
3. Editor reviews AI suggestions
4. Writer implements/overrides
5. Final AI check before publish
```

**Automation with Zapier:**
```
New Document in Drive
  → AI Parser (edit for tone)
  → Update Document
  → Slack notification to editor
```

### Best Practices

1. **Don't over-rely on AI** - Human judgment matters
2. **Train your AI** - Correct it when wrong
3. **Maintain brand voice** - Create custom presets
4. **Check for plagiarism** - AI can accidentally copy
5. **Review suggestions** - Not all are good
