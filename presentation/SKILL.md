## Purpose
Quickly create clear, structured briefs for presentations that align stakeholders and guide effective content development.

## Core Principles
- **Audience-first**: Start with who's listening and what they need
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Simple, direct communication wins
- **Purpose-driven**: Every element serves the presentation's goal
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what should happen after the presentation

## Brief Structure (5 Essential Elements)

1. **Objective**
   - Primary goal (inform, persuade, decide, inspire)
   - Desired outcome/action from audience
   - Success metrics

2. **Audience**
   - Key stakeholders & decision-makers
   - Their knowledge level & biases
   - What they care about most
   - Potential objections/questions

3. **Core Message**
