## Purpose
Quickly create clear, actionable presentation briefs that align stakeholders and guide effective slide development.

## Core Principles
- **Audience-First**: Start with who's receiving the presentation and what they need
- **Clarity Over Completeness**: Focus on essential messages, not every detail
- **Action-Oriented**: Every presentation should drive a specific outcome

## Brief Structure (5 Key Elements)

1. **Objective**
   - Primary goal (inform, persuade, decide)
   - Desired audience action/outcome
   - Success metrics

2. **Audience**
   - Key stakeholders & decision-makers
   - Their current knowledge/attitude
   - What they care about most

3. **Core Message**
   - Single most important idea (one sentence)
   - Supporting key points (3-5 max)
