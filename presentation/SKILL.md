## Purpose
Create clear, concise briefs that set presenters up for success by defining objectives, audience, and key messages.

## Key Components
- **Objective**: The single most important thing the presentation should achieve
- **Audience**: Who they are, what they care about, their current knowledge level
- **Core Message**: The one idea you want the audience to remember
- **Tone & Style**: Formal/casual, inspirational/data-driven, visual/text-heavy
- **Constraints**: Time limit, venue, technical requirements, brand guidelines

## Best Practices
- Start with \"After this presentation, the audience will...\"
- Keep to one page maximum
- Include specific success metrics when possible
- Align with broader organizational goals
- Specify what NOT to cover (scope boundaries)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Vague objectives (\"inform them about X\")
- Assuming audience knowledge level
- Too many key messages (stick"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
