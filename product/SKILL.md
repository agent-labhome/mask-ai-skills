## What It Is
A concise, strategic document that defines the core elements of a new product or feature *before* development begins. It aligns stakeholders on the **what, why, for whom, and how we'll measure success**.

## Core Principles
*   **Clarity Over Completeness:** A brief is a compass, not an encyclopedia. It should be scannable in 5 minutes.
*   **Problem-First:** Start with the user or business problem, not the solution.
*   **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on the desired impact and measurable goals.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** Once approved, it's the foundational reference for the entire team.

## Key Components (The \"Brief\" Formula)
1.  **Title & Initiative:** Clear, simple name for the project.
2.  **Problem Statement:** Who has the problem? What is the problem? Why is it important to solve now?
