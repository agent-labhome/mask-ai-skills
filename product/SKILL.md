## Purpose
A product brief is a concise document that clearly defines a new product or feature before development begins. It aligns stakeholders, guides the team, and serves as the foundation for detailed requirements.

## Core Components
A strong product brief should answer:

1.  **Problem & Opportunity:** What user pain point or business opportunity does this address? Why now?
2.  **Goal & Success:** What is the primary objective? How will we measure success (KPIs)?
3.  **Target User:** Who is this for? (Persona, user segment, or job-to-be-done)
4.  **Core Solution:** What is the proposed solution, described simply? What are the key features/scope?
5.  **Why & Why Not:** Why is this the right solution? What alternatives were considered and rejected?
6.  **Constraints & Dependencies:** What are the key timelines, technical limits, or required resources?
