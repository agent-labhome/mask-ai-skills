## Overview
A **Product Brief** is a concise document that defines the purpose, scope, and key requirements for a new product or a significant feature. It serves as the foundational agreement between stakeholders (business, design, engineering) before detailed design and development begin. This skill involves synthesizing business goals, user needs, and technical constraints into a clear, actionable guide.

## Core Components of a Product Brief

### 1. **The \"Why\" - Strategic Foundation**
*   **Problem Statement:** Clearly define the user or business problem being solved. (e.g., \"New users struggle to understand our core value within the first 30 seconds of using the app.\")
*   **Goal & Objectives:** State the primary goal and specific, measurable objectives (OKRs/KPIs). (e.g., \"Increase user activation rate by 15% in Q3.\")
*   **Success Metrics:** Define how success will be measured quantitatively and qualitatively.
