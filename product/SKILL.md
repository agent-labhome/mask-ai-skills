## Overview
A **Product Brief** is a strategic document that defines the purpose, scope, and key requirements for a new product or a significant feature. It serves as the foundational blueprint, aligning stakeholders and guiding the product development team from concept to launch.

## Core Purpose
To translate a business opportunity or user problem into a clear, actionable plan that:
*   **Aligns Stakeholders:** Ensures everyone (executives, product, design, engineering, marketing) shares the same vision and goals.
*   **Defines the \"What\" and \"Why\":** Clearly articulates the problem, the target user, the proposed solution, and the desired business outcomes.
*   **Scopes the Initiative:** Sets boundaries for what is in and out of scope for the initial launch (MVP).
*   **Guides Decision-Making:** Provides a north star for prioritizing features and making trade-offs during development.
