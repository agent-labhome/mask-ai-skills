## Overview
A Product Brief is a concise document that defines the core elements of a product or feature before development begins. It aligns stakeholders, clarifies objectives, and serves as a north star for the project team. This skill involves synthesizing strategy, user needs, and business goals into a clear, actionable plan.

## Core Components of a Strong Product Brief

### 1. **Problem & Opportunity**
*   **User Problem:** Clearly articulate the pain point or unmet need from the user's perspective. Use data or anecdotes to illustrate.
*   **Business Opportunity:** Explain why solving this problem matters to the business (e.g., increase retention, enter a new market, reduce costs).
*   **Market Context:** Briefly note competitive landscape or market trends that make this timely.

### 2. **Goals & Success Metrics**
*   **Primary Objective:** The single, overarching goal of this initiative (e.g., \"Reduce time to complete checkout by 30%\""},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
