## Purpose
A product brief is a concise document that aligns stakeholders on what to build, why it matters, and what success looks like—before detailed design or development begins.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity Over Completeness**: Focus on the essential \"why\" and \"what,\" not the exhaustive \"how.\"
- **Outcome-Oriented**: Define the problem and success metrics, not just features.
- **Collaborative Foundation**: Serves as a touchstone for product, design, and engineering teams.

## Key Components (The 5 Ws)
1.  **Why (Problem & Opportunity)**: The user pain point or business opportunity.
2.  **Who (Audience)**: Primary users/customers and stakeholders.
3.  **What (Solution & Scope)**: Core solution concept and key features (high-level).
4.  **What Success Looks Like (Goals & Metrics)**: Measurable outcomes (e"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
