2.  **Extract Key Variables:** Identify the user's stated goal (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, energy, management of a condition), dietary preferences/restrictions, and any specific foods or patterns mentioned.
3.  **Apply Expert Heuristics:** Match the input against a database of nutritional principles (macronutrient roles, caloric balance, nutrient density, meal timing basics, hydration, etc.).
4.  **Generate Brief Output:** Deliver a structured, bullet-point or very short paragraph response with 3-5 high-impact, specific recommendations. Tone is direct, authoritative, and practical.
