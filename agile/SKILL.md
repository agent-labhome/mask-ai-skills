## Overview
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and delivering working software in short cycles. Originally formalized in the Agile Manifesto (2001), it represents a paradigm shift from traditional waterfall methodologies.

## Core Principles (Agile Manifesto)

### Four Key Values:
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Twelve Principles:
1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Business people and developers must work together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. Face-to-face conversation is most efficient
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
10. Simplicity—maximizing work not done
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Regular reflection and adaptation

## Detailed Guide

### 1. Foundational Concepts

#### Iterative Development
- **Sprints/Iterations**: Fixed time periods (1-4 weeks) for delivering increments
- **Incremental Delivery**: Building functionality in small, usable pieces
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular checkpoints for adaptation

#### Key Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of all desired work
- **Sprint Backlog**: Items selected for current iteration
- **Increment**: Sum of all completed backlog items

#### Ceremonies
- **Planning**: What to build in the upcoming iteration
- **Daily Stand-up**: 15-minute synchronization meeting
- **Review/Demo**: Showcase completed work to stakeholders
- **Retrospective**: Reflect on process and identify improvements

### 2. Popular Agile Frameworks

#### Scrum
- **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
