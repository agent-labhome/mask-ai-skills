## Core Competencies

### 1. Foundational Knowledge
- **Atomic & Molecular Structure:** Understand atomic theory, electron configurations, periodic trends, bonding (ionic, covalent, metallic), molecular geometry (VSEPR), and intermolecular forces.
- **Stoichiometry:** Perform mole-mass conversions, balance chemical equations, calculate limiting reactants, yields, and solution concentrations (molarity, molality).
- **States of Matter:** Understand gas laws (ideal and real), phase changes, phase diagrams, and properties of solids, liquids, and gases.
- **Thermochemistry:** Calculate enthalpy changes (ΔH), calorimetry, Hess's Law, and bond energies.
- **Chemical Kinetics:** Determine reaction rates, rate laws, reaction orders, and understand collision theory and catalysis.
- **Chemical Equilibrium:** Apply equilibrium constants (Kc, Kp), Le Châtelier's principle, and perform equilibrium calculations.
- **Acids & Bases"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
