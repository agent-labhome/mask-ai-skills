## Overview
Reporting is the systematic process of collecting, analyzing, and presenting information to inform decision-making, track progress, and ensure accountability. Effective reporting transforms raw data into actionable insights through clear structure, relevant context, and professional presentation.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Purpose-Driven**
Every report must have a clear objective: to inform, persuade, recommend, or record. The purpose dictates content, depth, and format.

### 2. **Audience-Centric**
Tailor content, language, and detail level to the reader's role, expertise, and needs. Executives need summaries; technical teams need details.

### 3. **Accuracy & Integrity**
Data must be verified, sources cited, and biases acknowledged. Never manipulate data to fit a narrative.

### 4. **Clarity & Conciseness**
Present information logically, using plain language. Avoid jargon unless your audience expects it. Be thorough but not verbose.

### 5. **Action-Oriented**
Where appropriate, include clear recommendations, next steps, or calls to action. Reports should enable decisions.
