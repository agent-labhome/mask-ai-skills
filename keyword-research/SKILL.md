## What is Keyword Research?

Keyword research is the process of discovering and analyzing the search terms people enter into search engines to inform content strategy, SEO efforts, and business decisions. It's the foundation of understanding user intent and connecting your content with audience needs.

## Core Principles

### 1. Search Intent
Every keyword represents a user's intent, typically categorized as:
- **Informational**: Seeking knowledge (e.g., \"how to bake sourdough\")
- **Commercial**: Researching before purchase (e.g., \"best DSLR cameras 2024\")
- **Transactional**: Ready to buy (e.g., \"buy Nikon Z5 camera\")
- **Navigational**: Looking for specific site/page (e.g., \"Facebook login\")

### 2. Keyword Metrics
- **Search Volume**: Monthly searches (high ≠ always better)
- **Keyword Difficulty**: Competition level (0-100 scale)
- **Cost-Per-Click**: For paid search context
- **Trends**: Seasonal or growing interest
