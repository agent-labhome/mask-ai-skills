## Overview
Market research is the systematic process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information about a market, including information about potential customers, competitors, and the industry. This skill enables data-driven decision making and reduces business risk.

## Practical Framework

### Phase 1: Define Objectives & Scope
**Time: 30-60 minutes**

**Questions to Answer:**
- What specific decision will this research inform? (e.g., product launch, pricing, market entry)
- What do we need to know? (e.g., customer pain points, competitor pricing, market size)
- What is our research budget and timeline?
- Who are the key stakeholders for this research?

**Output:** 1-page research brief with clear objectives, key questions, and constraints.

### Phase 2: Choose Research Methods
**Time: 1-2 hours**

**Primary Research (Direct Data Collection):**
- **Surveys**: Quantitative data from target audience (use Google Forms, Typeform, SurveyMonkey)
- **Interviews**: Qualitative insights from 5-10 potential customers or industry experts
- **Focus Groups**: Group discussions (6-8 participants) for deeper qualitative insights
- **Observations**: Watching how people interact with products/services in natural settings

**Secondary Research (Existing Data):**
- **Industry Reports**: Statista, IBISWorld, MarketResearch.com
- **Competitor Analysis**: Analyze websites, pricing, marketing, customer reviews
- **Public Data**: Government statistics, trade associations, academic journals
- **Social Listening**: Monitor social media conversations (Brandwatch, Mention, free tools)
- **SEO/SEM Analysis**: Use SEMrush or Ahrefs to understand search behavior
