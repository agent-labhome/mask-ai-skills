- Who are the key stakeholders for this research?

**Output:** 1-page research brief with clear objectives, key questions, and constraints.

**Time: 1-2 hours**

**Primary Research (Direct Data Collection):**
- **Surveys**: Quantitative data from target audience (use Google Forms, Typeform, SurveyMonkey)
