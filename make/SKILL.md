## Overview
**Make. Brief.** is a communication skill focused on distilling complex ideas, instructions, or information into their most essential, clear, and actionable form. It is the discipline of removing redundancy, ambiguity, and filler to deliver maximum value with minimum words.

This is not merely about being concise; it's about precision, clarity, and respect for the recipient's time and cognitive load.

## Core Principles

1.  **Essence Over Exhaustion:** Identify the single core message or objective. What must the audience know, feel, or do?
2.  **Structure is Scannable:** Use formatting (headings, lists, bolding) to guide the eye. Assume your message will be skimmed.
3.  **Jargon is a Barrier:** Use the simplest language that accurately conveys the meaning. Explain necessary acronyms.
4.  **Context is Key:** Provide just enough background for understanding, not a history lesson"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
