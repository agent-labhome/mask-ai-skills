# SKILL: Launch.Brief

## Overview
**Launch.Brief** is a structured framework for creating high-impact project briefs that align teams, clarify objectives, and accelerate execution. It transforms vague ideas into actionable plans with clear success metrics.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Completeness** - Better to be clear and concise than exhaustive and confusing
2. **Outcome-Focused** - Define what success looks like, not just what to build
3. **Stakeholder-Aligned** - Ensure all parties share the same understanding
4. **Action-Oriented** - Every element should drive toward execution

## The Brief Framework

- **Project Name**: Memorable and descriptive
- **Tagline**: One-line summary of the project's purpose
- **Owner**: Single point of accountability
- **Core Team**: Key contributors and their roles

### 2. Strategic Context
