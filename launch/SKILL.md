## Purpose
A structured framework for launching projects, initiatives, or products by creating clear, actionable briefs that align teams and stakeholders.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Completeness** - Better a clear 80% than a confusing 100%
2. **Alignment Before Action** - Get buy-in before execution
3. **Flexible Structure** - Adapt the framework to your context
4. **Human-Centered** - Consider who needs what and why

## The Framework

### 1. **The Foundation** (The \"Why\")
- **Project Name**: Memorable and descriptive
- **Core Objective**: One sentence that defines success
- **Strategic Why**: How this connects to larger goals
- **Success Metrics**: How we'll know we succeeded (KPIs, OKRs)

### 2. **The Context** (The \"What\")
- **Current State**: What exists today
- **Problem/Opportun"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
