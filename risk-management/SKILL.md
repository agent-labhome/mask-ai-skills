## Executive Summary
Risk Management is the systematic process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating threats to an organization's capital, earnings, and operations. Effective risk management transforms uncertainty from a threat into a managed variable, creating competitive advantage and organizational resilience.

## Core Framework

### 1. Risk Identification
**Objective:** Systematically uncover potential threats and opportunities

**Methods:**
- **Brainstorming Sessions:** Cross-functional workshops using prompts like \"What could go wrong?\" and \"What unexpected opportunities might emerge?\"
- **SWOT Analysis:** Structured examination of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
- **Process Mapping:** Walk through key business processes to identify failure points
- **Historical Analysis:** Review past incidents, near-misses, and industry case studies
- **Stakeholder Interviews:** Consult employees, customers, suppliers, and regulators
- **PESTLE Analysis:** Examine Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental factors

**Business Application:** Schedule quarterly risk identification workshops with rotating departmental representation. Maintain a living \"risk radar\" document.

### 2. Risk Assessment & Prioritization
**Objective:** Evaluate and rank risks based on probability and impact

**Tools:**
- **Risk Matrix:** Plot risks on a 5x5 grid (Probability x Impact)
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Assign financial values to potential losses/gains
- **Risk Heat Maps:** Visual representation of risk concentration
- **Scenario Analysis:** \"What-if\" modeling for extreme but plausible events

**Prioritization Criteria:**
1. **Critical Risks:** High probability + High impact (Immediate action required)
2. **Significant Risks:** Medium probability + High impact OR High probability + Medium impact (Action plan needed)
3. **Moderate Risks:** Manage through standard procedures
4. **Minor Risks:** Accept and monitor

**Business Application:** Create a standardized scoring system. For example:
