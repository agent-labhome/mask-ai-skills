## Overview
Performance Management is a systematic process for improving organizational performance by developing individual and team performance within an agreed framework of planned goals, standards, and competency requirements. It transforms traditional \"annual review\" approaches into continuous, development-focused partnerships between managers and employees.

## Core Principles

### 1. Continuous vs. Episodic
- **Traditional**: Annual reviews, backward-looking, evaluative
- **Modern**: Ongoing conversations, forward-looking, developmental
- **Frequency**: Weekly check-ins, quarterly conversations, annual formal review

### 2. Development-Focused
- Balance accountability with growth
- Focus on strengths while addressing gaps
- Link individual development to organizational needs

### 3. Collaborative
- Manager as coach, not just evaluator
- Employee ownership of development
- Two-way dialogue and feedback

## The Performance Management Cycle

### Phase 1: Goal Setting & Planning (Quarter 1)
**Objective**: Establish clear expectations and alignment

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Organizational Context** (Manager-led)
   - Share team/department objectives
   - Explain how individual contributions connect to bigger picture
   - Discuss constraints and resources

2. **SMART Goal Co-creation** (Collaborative)
   - **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous objectives
   - **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria
   - **Achievable**: Realistic yet challenging
   - **Relevant**: Aligned with organizational priorities
   - **Time-bound**: Clear deadlines and milestones

   *Example transformation*:
   - ❌ \"Improve customer satisfaction\"
   - ✅ \"Increase Net Promoter Score from 65 to 75 by Q3 through implementing 3 new feedback mechanisms and reducing response time by 20%\"

3. **Competency Development Planning**
   - Identify 2-3 key skills to develop
   - Create learning action plan (courses, mentoring, stretch assignments)
   - Set behavioral indicators of progress

4. **Documentation & Agreement**
   - Capture in shared system/template
   - Both parties sign off
