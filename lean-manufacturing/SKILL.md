## Overview
Lean Manufacturing is a systematic approach to identifying and eliminating waste (non-value-added activities) through continuous improvement while delivering value to customers. Originating from the Toyota Production System, Lean focuses on creating more value with fewer resources by optimizing flow and eliminating muda (waste), mura (unevenness), and muri (overburden).

## Core Principles

### 1. Define Value from Customer Perspective
- **Action:** Identify what customers truly value and are willing to pay for
- **Tool:** Voice of Customer (VOC) analysis, Kano Model
- **Output:** Value criteria matrix, customer requirement specifications

### 2. Map the Value Stream
- **Action:** Document all steps in your process, identifying value-added vs. non-value-added activities
- **Tool:** Value Stream Mapping (Current State → Future State)
- **Output:** Visual process map with cycle times, wait times, inventory levels

### 3. Create Continuous Flow
- **Action:** Eliminate batch processing and create smooth workflow
- **Tool:** Cellular manufacturing, line balancing, single-piece flow
- **Output:** Reduced work-in-progress, shorter lead times

### 4. Establish Pull Systems
- **Action:** Produce only what is needed when it is needed
- **Tool:** Kanban systems, supermarket pull systems
- **Output:** Reduced inventory, improved cash flow

### 5. Pursue Perfection
- **Action:** Continuously identify and eliminate waste
- **Tool:** Kaizen events, PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycles
- **Output:** Continuous improvement culture, standardized work
