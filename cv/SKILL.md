## Overview
A Curriculum Vitae (CV) is a comprehensive document detailing your professional and academic history. Unlike a resume (typically 1-2 pages), a CV is more detailed and can extend multiple pages, particularly for academic, research, medical, or international positions. This guide covers both traditional CVs and the more concise resume format commonly used in North America.

## Core Principles

### 1. Purpose-Driven Design
- **Primary Objective**: Secure interviews, not jobs
- **Key Function**: Demonstrate how your specific qualifications solve employer problems
- **Audience Awareness**: Tailor content for both HR screeners (keywords) and hiring managers (achievements)

### 2. Strategic Positioning
- **Value Proposition**: Clearly communicate what makes you uniquely qualified
- **Relevance Filter**: Include only information that supports your target position
- **Professional Narrative**: Create a coherent story of career progression and growth

## Structural Components

### 1. Contact Information (Header)
```
Jane A. Professional, PhD
[Phone] • [Email] • [LinkedIn URL] • [Portfolio/GitHub if relevant]
[City, State] • [Optional: Willing to relocate]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use professional email (first.last@domain.com)
- Include only relevant contact methods
- Ensure LinkedIn profile is updated and consistent

### 2. Professional Summary / Profile (Optional but Recommended)
- 3-4 lines maximum
- Tailor to each application
- Include: Years of experience, key expertise, career objective
- Example: \"Data scientist with 7+ years experience in machine learning and predictive analytics, seeking to leverage statistical modeling expertise to improve customer retention at growth-stage tech companies.\"

### 3. Professional Experience (Reverse Chronological)
**Standard Format:**
```
Job Title, Company Name
City, State | Month Year – Month Year
