## Purpose
To deliver clear, concise, and actionable data-driven insights that directly answer a business question or support a decision.

## Core Principles
- **Start with the Question:** Every brief must be anchored to a specific business objective or problem.
- **Clarity Over Complexity:** Use simple language. Avoid jargon unless essential.
- **Action-Oriented:** Insights must lead to a clear \"So what?\" and recommended next steps.
- **Audience-First:** Tailor depth, tone, and format to the stakeholder (e.g., executive vs. technical team).

## Brief Structure (The ABC Format)
1.  **Aim:** State the core business question in one sentence.
2.  **Background:** Provide essential context in 2-3 bullet points (why this matters, key constraints).
3.  **Core Findings:** Present the 2-3 most critical data points or insights. Use simple charts or numbers.
