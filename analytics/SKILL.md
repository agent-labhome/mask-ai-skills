## Purpose
Transform ambiguous business questions into structured, actionable analytics briefs that align stakeholders, define scope, and set clear expectations for data projects.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Completeness** - A brief that is understood is better than one that is comprehensive but confusing
2. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Ensure all parties agree on the problem, approach, and success criteria before work begins
3. **Action-Oriented** - Every analysis should lead to a decision or action
4. **Scope Discipline** - Define what's in and out of scope to prevent scope creep
