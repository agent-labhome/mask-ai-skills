## What is Product Strategy?

Product strategy is the high-level plan that defines *why* a product should exist, *who* it serves, *what* value it delivers, and *how* it will achieve sustainable competitive advantage. It connects company vision to executable tactics.

## Core Framework: The Strategy Stack

```
Vision → Product Strategy → Goals/OKRs → Roadmap → Execution
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Market Problem & Opportunity:** What pain point are we solving? How big is the opportunity?
2. **Target Audience & Segmentation:** Who specifically are we serving? (Not \"everyone\")
3. **Value Proposition:** What unique value do we deliver? Why choose us?
4. **Business Model:** How do we capture value? (Revenue, growth, engagement)
5. **Competitive Advantage:** What's our moat? (Technology, network effects, brand, etc.)
6. **Strategic Themes:** 2-3 focus areas for the next 12-18 months
