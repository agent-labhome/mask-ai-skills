## Overview
Backlink building is the practice of acquiring hyperlinks from other websites to your own, a critical factor in search engine ranking algorithms. Quality backlinks signal to search engines that your content is authoritative, trustworthy, and valuable.

## Core Principles

### 1. Quality Over Quantity
- **Authority Matters:** A single link from a high-domain-authority site (like .edu, .gov, or major publications) is more valuable than dozens from low-quality sites.
- **Relevance is Key:** Links from sites in your niche or related industries carry more weight than unrelated links.
- **Natural Link Profile:** Avoid patterns that appear manipulative (like exact-match anchor text overuse).

### 2. The E-A-T Framework
- **Expertise:** Demonstrate deep knowledge in your field
- **Authoritativeness:** Build credibility through citations and references
- **Trustworthiness:** Maintain transparency and ethical practices

## Practical Implementation Guide

**B. Resource Audit**
1. Inventory your existing \"linkable assets\":
   - Original research/data studies
   - Comprehensive guides/tutorials
