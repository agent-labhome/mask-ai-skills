- **Data Engineering:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and pipeline construction for model training.
- **Model Deployment:** Containerization (Docker), API development (FastAPI, Flask), and cloud platform deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- **MLOps:** Versioning (DVC, MLflow), CI/CD for ML, and model monitoring in production.

**Key Tools & Frameworks:**
- **Languages:** Python (primary), SQL, (optional: R, Julia)
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Hugging Face, LangChain
- **Infrastructure:** Git, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud services
