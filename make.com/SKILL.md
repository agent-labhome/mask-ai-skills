## Practical Guide

### Core Concepts
1. **Scenarios**: Automated workflows you build
2. **Modules**: Building blocks (triggers, actions, routers, filters)
3. **Operations**: Individual steps in a scenario
4. **Data Structures**: How information flows between modules

### Getting Started
1. **Sign up** for a free account at make.com
2. **Explore templates** for common use cases
3. **Start simple** with 2-3 app connections
4. **Use the visual editor** to drag and drop modules

### Common Use Cases
- **Marketing**: Sync leads between forms, CRM, and email tools
- **E-commerce**: Connect store platforms with shipping and inventory systems
- **Productivity**: Automate notifications, task creation, and file management
- **Data Processing**: Transform, filter, and route data between systems

### Best Practices
1. **Start with a clear goal** - Know what you want to automate before building
2. **Use filters early** - Reduce unnecessary operations by filtering data upfront
3. **Implement error handling** - Use routers to catch and manage errors
4. **Monitor operations** - Check your scenario history regularly
5. **Optimize scheduling** - Don't run scenarios more frequently than"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":350,"total_tokens":368,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":18},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
