## What It Is
A mental practice of focused attention and awareness, training the mind to observe thoughts without judgment and return to a chosen anchor (breath, mantra, or sensation).

## Core Purpose
To cultivate present-moment awareness, reduce reactivity, and create space between stimulus and response.

## Basic Practice (5-Minute Start)
1. **Sit comfortably** â Spine upright, eyes closed or softly focused.
2. **Set intention** â Simply to be present.
3. **Focus on breath** â Feel natural inhalation and exhalation.
4. **Notice wandering mind** â Gently return attention to breath each time.
5. **Close gently** â Slowly return to surroundings.

## Key Insight
Meditation is not about stopping thoughts, but changing your relationship to them. The practice is in the returning.
