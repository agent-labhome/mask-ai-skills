## Purpose
A brief, accessible meditation practice to cultivate calm, focus, and present-moment awareness.

## Core Practice (5-Minute Version)

1.  **Posture:** Sit comfortably with a straight, relaxed spine. Hands rest on knees or lap.
2.  **Intention:** Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Set a simple intention to be present.
3.  **Anchor:** Bring full attention to the physical sensation of your natural breath. Don't control it; just feel it.
4.  **Notice & Return:** When your mind wanders (it will), gently note \"thinking\" and return attention to the breath. This *is* the practice.
5.  **Expand:** After a few minutes, expand awareness to include sounds, bodily sensations, and the space around you.
6.  **Close:** Gently open your eyes. Take a moment to transition before moving.
