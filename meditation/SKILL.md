**Purpose:** Cultivate focus, calm, and present-moment awareness.

**Core Practice:**
1. **Posture:** Sit comfortably, spine reasonably straight.
2. **Focus:** Gently anchor attention on a single point (e.g., breath, a mantra, bodily sensation).
3. **Observe:** When the mind wanders (it will), notice the distraction without judgment.
4. **Return:** Gently guide attention back to the anchor. This return *is* the practice.

**Key Principles:**
*   **Consistency > Duration:** 5 minutes daily is better than 30 minutes once a week.
*   **Non-Judgment:** Treat thoughts and feelings as passing clouds, not facts to engage with.
*   **It's a Practice:** There is no \"perfect\" meditation. The act of starting again is success.

**Quick Start:** Set a timer for 3-5 minutes.
