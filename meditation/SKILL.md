## What It Is
A mental practice of focused attention and awareness, training the mind to observe thoughts without judgment and return to a chosen anchor (breath, mantra, or sensation).

## Core Practice
1. **Posture:** Sit comfortably, spine reasonably straight.
2. **Anchor:** Gently focus attention on the breath (sensations of inhaling/exhaling).
3. **Observe:** When the mind wanders (it will), notice the thought or distraction without criticism.
4. **Return:** Gently guide attention back to the breath. This return *is* the practice.

## Key Principles
- **Non-Judgment:** Observe thoughts as passing events, not as \"good\" or \"bad.\"
- **Consistency:** Short daily sessions (5-10 minutes) are more effective than occasional long ones.
- **Patience:** The benefit is in the repeated act of returning, not in achieving a perfectly empty mind.
