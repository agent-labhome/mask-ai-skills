## Core Definition
Computer Vision (CV) is the field of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and to take actions or make recommendations based on that information.

## Key Capabilities

**1. Image Classification & Recognition**
- Identifying and categorizing objects within an image
- Scene recognition and understanding
- Brand/logo detection

**2. Object Detection & Localization**
- Finding and identifying multiple objects within an image
- Drawing bounding boxes around detected objects
- Real-time detection capabilities

**3. Image Segmentation**
- Semantic segmentation (pixel-level classification)
- Instance segmentation (distinguishing between object instances)
- Panoptic segmentation (combining semantic and instance)

**4. Feature Extraction & Matching**
- Identifying key points and descriptors
- Image stitching and panorama creation
