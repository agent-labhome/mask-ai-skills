## Overview
Documentation is the practice of creating, maintaining, and organizing written materials that explain how systems, processes, or products work. Effective documentation serves as a single source of truth, reduces cognitive load for users, and enables knowledge transfer across teams and time.

## Why Documentation Matters
- **Reduces Bus Factor**: Prevents knowledge loss when team members leave
- **Accelerates Onboarding**: New team members can get up to speed independently
- **Improves Consistency**: Establishes standards and best practices
- **Saves Time**: Reduces repetitive questions and troubleshooting sessions
- **Enables Scaling**: Allows teams to grow without constant supervision

## Core Principles

### 1. **Audience Awareness**
Documentation should be tailored to its intended readers:
- **End Users**: Focus on \"how to\" with minimal technical jargon
- **Developers/Technical Staff**: Include implementation details, APIs, architecture
- **Maintainers**: Document decisions, troubleshooting, and maintenance procedures

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
Present information in layers:
- Start with the simplest path to value
- Add complexity gradually
- Allow users to dive deeper as needed

### 3. **Living Documentation**
Documentation should be:
- **Versioned**: Tied to specific releases or states
- **Maintained**: Regularly reviewed and updated
- **Accessible**: Easy to find and search

### 4. **Single Source of Truth**
Avoid duplication. When information exists in multiple places, it becomes:
- Hard to keep synchronized
- Confusing when versions differ
- Time-consuming to maintain

## Practical Guide

### Step 1: Assess Documentation Needs

**Questions to ask:**
- Who will use this documentation? (Define personas)
- What problems are they trying to solve?
- What existing knowledge can you"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":21,"completion_tokens":450,"total_tokens":471,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":21},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
