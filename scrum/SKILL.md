## Overview
A Scrum Brief is a concise, structured document that captures the essential information needed to initiate a new project, feature, or initiative within a Scrum framework. It serves as a lightweight starting point for the Product Owner and Development Team to begin discovery and backlog refinement.

## Purpose
- Align stakeholders on the **what** and **why** before detailed planning.
- Provide just enough context for the Product Owner to create initial backlog items.
- Establish clear goals, scope, and success criteria without over-specifying solutions.
- Accelerate the transition from idea to actionable Sprint Backlog items.

### 2. Business Objective & Problem Statement
