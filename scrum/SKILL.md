## Overview
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It is founded on empirical process control theory (empiricism), which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.

## Core Principles

### 1. Empirical Process Control
- **Transparency**: Significant aspects must be visible to those responsible for outcomes
- **Inspection**: Scrum artifacts and progress must be inspected frequently
- **Adaptation**: Adjustments must be made if processes deviate outside acceptable limits

### 2. Self-Organization
- Teams choose how best to accomplish their work
- Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed
- Promotes creativity, flexibility, and productivity

### 3. Collaboration
- Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers work together
- Focus on delivering value through collaboration
- Daily synchronization and planning

### 4. Value-Based Prioritization
- Work is prioritized based on value delivery
- Regular inspection and adaptation of priorities
- Focus on delivering the highest value items first
