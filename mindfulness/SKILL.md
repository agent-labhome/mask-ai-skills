## What It Is
A mental practice of focusing awareness on the present moment, observing thoughts and sensations without judgment.

## Core Components
1. **Focused Attention** - Anchoring awareness (breath, body, sounds)
2. **Non-Judgmental Observation** - Noticing without labeling as good/bad
3. **Present-Moment Awareness** - Engaging fully with the \"now\"

## Quick Practices
- **One-Minute Breath**: Follow three full breath cycles
- **Sensory Check-in**: Notice 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste
- **Daily Activity Anchor**: Bring full attention to one routine task (drinking coffee, washing hands)

## Common Applications
- Stress reduction
- Emotional regulation
