## Purpose
A brief, accessible mindfulness practice to center attention and reduce stress.

## Core Practice (60 seconds)
1. **Pause** – Stop current activity.
2. **Posture** – Sit or stand comfortably, feet grounded.
3. **Breath** – Notice 3 natural breaths without changing them.
4. **Body Scan** – Feel one point of contact (e.g., feet on floor, hands resting).
5. **Return** – Gently resume your activity.

## When to Use
- Before starting a task
- During transitions
- When feeling overwhelmed
- As a regular daily reset

## Key Principle
Mindfulness is noticing the present moment without judgment. Even 60 seconds can create space between stimulus and response."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":159,"total_tokens":173,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
