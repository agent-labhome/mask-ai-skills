## Purpose
A copywriting brief is a strategic document that aligns stakeholders and copywriters by clearly defining the objectives, audience, message, and requirements for a piece of copy. Its purpose is to eliminate guesswork, streamline the creative process, and ensure the final output achieves its intended business goal.

## Core Principles

1.  **Clarity Over Completeness:** A good brief is clear and actionable, not necessarily long. Ambiguity is the enemy.
2.  **Strategic Foundation:** It connects creative work to business objectives (e.g., increase sales, build brand awareness, reduce support calls).
3.  **Single Source of Truth:** It is the reference point for all decisions and feedback, preventing scope creep and misalignment.
4.  **Collaborative Tool:** It should be developed with input from key stakeholders (marketing, product, sales) and serve as a agreement with the writer.
