## Purpose
Create clear, actionable briefs that align stakeholders and empower copywriters to produce effective, on-brand content.

## Core Principles

**Clarity Over Creativity**
- Define objectives before solutions
- Use plain language, avoid jargon
- Specify what success looks like

**Context is King**
- Include business goals, not just creative asks
- Provide audience insights, not just demographics
- Share competitive landscape

**Constraints Enable Creativity**
- Define guardrails (tone, voice, legal requirements)
- Specify practical limits (word count, formats, timeline)
- Note mandatory inclusions (CTAs, keywords, disclosures)

## Essential Components

1. **Objective** - What should this copy achieve?
