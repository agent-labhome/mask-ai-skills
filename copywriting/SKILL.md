## Overview

Copywriting is the art and science of persuasive writing that motivates readers to take specific actions—whether purchasing a product, subscribing to a service, clicking a link, or adopting an idea. Unlike general content writing, copywriting is fundamentally conversion-focused.

## Core Principles

### 1. **AIDA Framework** (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
- **Attention:** Grab the reader immediately
- **Interest:** Maintain engagement with relevant information
- **Desire:** Create emotional connection and want
- **Action:** Provide clear, compelling instruction

### 2. **Know Your Audience**
- Develop detailed buyer personas
- Speak their language, address their pain points
- Understand where they are in the customer journey

### 3. **Benefit-Oriented Communication**
- Focus on what the customer gains (benefits) rather than just features
- \"Saves 10 hours weekly\" vs. \"Automated reporting feature\"

### 4. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Simple, direct language typically outperforms complex prose
- One clear message per piece of copy
