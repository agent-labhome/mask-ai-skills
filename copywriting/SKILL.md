## Overview
Copywriting is the art and science of persuasive writing for business purposes. Unlike content writing which primarily informs or entertains, copywriting aims to persuade readers to take specific actions—making purchases, subscribing, clicking, or engaging with a brand.

## Core Principles

### 1. **The AIDA Model**
- **Attention:** Grab the reader immediately
- **Interest:** Build curiosity and relevance
- **Desire:** Create emotional connection and need
- **Action:** Provide clear, compelling call-to-action

### 2. **Features vs. Benefits**
- **Features:** What the product/service is or has
- **Benefits:** What the customer gains or experiences
- **Formula:** \"So that...\" (connects feature to benefit)

### 3. **Know Your Audience**
- Develop detailed buyer personas
- Understand pain points, desires, and language
- Write to one person, not a crowd

### 4. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Simple, direct language outperforms complex prose
- One main idea per sentence/paragraph
- Eliminate jargon unless audience-specific
