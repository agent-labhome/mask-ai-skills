## Purpose
A well-structured copywriting brief is the foundation of effective marketing communication. This skill transforms vague requests into actionable, strategic direction that aligns stakeholders, guides writers, and ensures the final copy achieves business objectives.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Strategic Alignment**
   - Every brief must connect copy to business goals
   - Copy exists to solve problems, not just fill space
   - Audience needs must balance with business objectives

### 2. **Clarity Over Completeness**
   - A clear, concise brief beats a lengthy, ambiguous one
   - Prioritize essential information writers actually use
   - Eliminate jargon and internal terminology

### 3. **Collaborative Foundation**
   - The brief is a contract between stakeholders and writer
   - It should answer questions before they're asked
   - Creates shared understanding of success metrics
