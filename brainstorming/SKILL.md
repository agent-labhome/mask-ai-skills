## Overview
A structured guide for facilitating effective brainstorming sessions to generate creative ideas and solutions.

## Core Principles
- **Quantity over quality** - Generate as many ideas as possible initially
- **Withhold judgment** - No criticism during idea generation phase
- **Encourage wild ideas** - Unconventional thinking often leads to breakthroughs
- **Build on others' ideas** - Use \"yes, and...\" approach to expand concepts

## Session Structure

- **Define the problem clearly** - What specific challenge are we addressing?
- **Set objectives** - What does success look like?
- **Select participants** (5-10 ideal)
- **Choose facilitator** - Neutral party to guide discussion
- **Prepare materials** - Whiteboards, sticky notes, markers, timers
- **Schedule** - 30-90 minutes, avoid end-of-day fatigue
