## Overview

Upselling is a sales technique where customers are encouraged to purchase a higher-end version of a product, add premium features, or buy additional items that complement their original purchase. Unlike cross-selling (which suggests related but different products), upselling focuses on enhancing the value of the customer's current selection.

**Core Philosophy:** Provide genuine value enhancement, not just price increases. Successful upselling creates win-win outcomes where customers receive greater satisfaction and the business increases revenue.
