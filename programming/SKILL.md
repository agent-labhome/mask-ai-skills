## Core Competencies
- **Problem Analysis**: Breaking down complex problems into logical components
- **Algorithm Design**: Creating step-by-step solutions before implementation
- **Code Implementation**: Writing clean, efficient code in relevant languages
- **Debugging**: Identifying, isolating, and fixing errors systematically
- **Testing**: Validating functionality through unit and integration tests

## Key Practices
- **Readability**: Writing self-documenting code with clear naming
- **Modularity**: Creating reusable, single-responsibility components
- **Version Control**: Using Git for tracking changes and collaboration
- **Documentation**: Commenting complex logic and maintaining READMEs
- **Code Review**: Giving and receiving constructive feedback on implementations

## Mindset
- **Iterative Development**: Building in small, testable increments
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with languages, tools, and best practices
- **Resource Awareness**: Considering time/space complexity and system constraints
