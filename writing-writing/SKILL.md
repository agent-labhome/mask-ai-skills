# SKILL: Writing

## Core Principles
- **Clarity**: Communicate ideas simply and directly
- **Structure**: Organize thoughts logically (introduction â body â conclusion)
- **Purpose**: Every piece should have a clear goal and audience

## Key Practices
- **Draft first**, edit later
- **Read aloud** to catch awkward phrasing
- **Cut unnecessary words** (be concise)
- **Use active voice** when possible
- **Vary sentence structure** for rhythm

## Quick Checklist
- [ ] Main point clear in first paragraph?
- [ ] Each paragraph supports the main idea?
- [ ] Transitions smooth between ideas?
- [ ] Spelling and grammar checked?
- [ ] Would a stranger understand this?

## Remember
Good writing is **rewriting**. The first draft is just raw material."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":171,"total_tokens":187,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache
