## Core Principles
- **Clarity**: Express ideas simply and directly
- **Structure**: Organize thoughts logically (introduction → body → conclusion)
- **Purpose**: Every piece should have a clear goal
- **Audience**: Write for your reader, not yourself

## Key Practices
1. **Draft freely** → Edit ruthlessly
2. **Show, don't just tell** (use examples, specifics)
3. **Read aloud** to catch awkward phrasing
4. **Cut unnecessary words** (be concise)

## Quick Checklist
- [ ] Main point clear in first paragraph?
- [ ] Each paragraph supports the main idea?
- [ ] Transitions smooth between thoughts?
- [ ] Active voice preferred?
- [ ] Proofread for errors?
