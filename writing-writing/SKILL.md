## Core Principles
- **Clarity First**: Simple, precise language beats complexity.
- **Purpose-Driven**: Every piece should have a clear goal.
- **Audience Awareness**: Write for the reader, not yourself.
- **Conciseness**: Omit needless words. Be direct.

## Key Practices
- **Plan**: Outline main points before drafting.
- **Draft Freely**: Get ideas down; edit later.
- **Edit Ruthlessly**: Cut, tighten, and clarify in revisions.
- **Read Aloud**: Catch awkward phrasing and rhythm issues.
- **Seek Feedback**: Fresh eyes reveal blind spots.
