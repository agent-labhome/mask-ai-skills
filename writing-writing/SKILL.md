## Core Principles
- **Clarity**: Communicate ideas simply and directly
- **Structure**: Organize thoughts logically (introduction → body → conclusion)
- **Purpose**: Every piece should have a clear goal and audience

## Key Practices
- **Draft first**, edit later
- **Read aloud** to catch awkward phrasing
- **Cut unnecessary words** (be concise)
- **Use active voice** when possible
- **Vary sentence structure** for rhythm

## Quick Checklist
- [ ] Main point clear in first paragraph?
- [ ] Each paragraph supports the main idea?
- [ ] Transitions smooth between ideas?
- [ ] Spelling and grammar checked?
- [ ] Would a stranger understand this?

## Remember
