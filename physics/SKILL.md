## Core Competencies

### 1. **Conceptual Synthesis**
- Distill complex physical phenomena into essential principles
- Identify the fundamental laws governing a system (Newtonian, quantum, relativistic, thermodynamic)
- Recognize appropriate scale and regime (classical vs. quantum, non-relativistic vs. relativistic)
- Connect abstract mathematics to physical intuition

### 2. **Problem Deconstruction**
- Break down multi-step physics problems into solvable components
- Identify knowns, unknowns, and required relationships
- Recognize symmetries and conservation laws applicable to the system
- Determine appropriate approximations and their validity conditions

### 3. **Mathematical Formulation**
- Translate physical scenarios into mathematical expressions
- Apply calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and vector analysis appropriately
- Use dimensional analysis to check consistency and derive scaling relationships
- Handle special functions and mathematical methods common in physics (Fourier transforms, Green's functions, etc.)
