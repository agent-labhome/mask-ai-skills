## Core Purpose
To produce clear, evidence-based, structured, and formally styled written work for scholarly audiences.

## Key Principles
1.  **Clarity & Precision:** Use unambiguous language. Define key terms. Avoid unnecessary jargon.
2.  **Evidence-Based Argument:** Claims must be supported by credible sources (research, data, theory). Proper citation is non-negotiable.
3.  **Formal & Objective Tone:** Avoid colloquialisms, contractions, and emotional language. Use the third person unless specified otherwise (e.g., reflective essays).
4.  **Structured Logic:** Follow a clear introduction-body-conclusion framework. Each paragraph should present one main idea, linked to the next.
5.  **Critical Engagement:** Don't just describe; analyze, evaluate, and synthesize ideas from sources.

## Essential Components
*   **Thesis Statement:** A clear, debatable claim that guides the entire paper. Usually appears in the introduction.
