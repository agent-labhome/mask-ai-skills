# Seed Round

## Overview
The Seed Round is typically the first significant equity financing for a startup. It follows pre-seed funding (often from founders, friends, and family) and precedes Series A. This round provides capital to achieve product-market fit, build a core team, and generate early traction that will support a larger Series A round.

## Primary Objectives
- **Product Development:** Complete an MVP or enhance an existing prototype.
- **Initial Hiring:** Recruit key early team members (e.g., engineers, first sales hire).
- **Market Validation:** Gather user feedback, secure pilot customers, and demonstrate initial traction.
- **Metrics & Data:** Establish key performance indicators (KPIs)"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":250,"total_tokens":266,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
