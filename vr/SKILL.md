## Purpose
Transform abstract VR concepts into structured, actionable development briefs that align creative vision with technical feasibility.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Concept Analysis & Structuring**
- Deconstruct abstract VR ideas into core components
- Identify implicit requirements and constraints
- Map user journeys and experience flows
- Define spatial relationships and interaction paradigms

### 2. **Technical Specification Translation**
- Convert creative requirements into technical parameters:
  - Performance targets (FPS, latency, resolution)
  - Hardware requirements (PCVR, Standalone, Mobile)
  - Interaction systems (hand tracking, controllers, haptics)
  - Audio specifications (spatial audio, ambisonics)
  - Asset pipelines (polycount, texture budgets, LODs)

### 3. **Experience Design Documentation**
- Create structured briefs including:
  - **Project Overview**: Vision statement, target audience, success metrics
  - **Experience Flow**:"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
