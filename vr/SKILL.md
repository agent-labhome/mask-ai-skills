## Purpose
This skill enables the creation of comprehensive, actionable briefs for virtual reality projects. It transforms initial ideas or requirements into structured documents that guide VR development teams through technical specifications, user experience design, and project requirements.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Brief Structuring**
- Formats VR briefs with consistent sections
- Organizes information from high-level vision to technical details
- Creates logical flow from objectives to requirements

### 2. **Requirement Analysis**
- Identifies and clarifies ambiguous requirements
- Asks probing questions to uncover unstated needs
- Distinguishes between essential features and nice-to-haves

### 3. **Technical Specification**
- Defines VR platform requirements (standalone, PCVR, mobile, etc.)
- Specifies hardware considerations (controllers, tracking, haptics)
- Outlines performance targets (frame rates, resolution, latency)

### 4. **UX/Design Guidance**
