# SKILL: VR Brief Development

## Overview
The VR Brief Development skill enables users to create comprehensive, actionable briefs for virtual reality projects. This skill transforms initial VR concepts into structured documents that align stakeholder expectations, define technical requirements, and establish clear project parameters.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Brief Structuring**
- Automatically organizes VR briefs into logical sections
- Creates templates for different VR project types (training, entertainment, architectural visualization, etc.)
- Ensures all critical components are addressed systematically

### 2. **Stakeholder Alignment**
- Identifies and documents key stakeholders
- Clarifies project objectives and success metrics
- Aligns business goals with technical feasibility

### 3. **Technical Specification**
- Defines hardware requirements (HMDs, controllers, tracking systems)
- Specifies software platforms (Unity, Unreal Engine, WebXR)
- Outlines performance targets (frame rates, resolution, latency)
