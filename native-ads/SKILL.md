## What It Is
The ability to create paid content that matches the look, feel, and function of the platform it appears on (e.g., social feeds, news sites). It's advertising designed to be less disruptive.

## Core Principle
**Blend, Don't Interrupt.** The ad should feel like a natural part of the user's experience.

## Key Components
1.  **Visual Integration:** Matches the site/app's design (fonts, colors, card style).
2.  **Content Alignment:** Presents as useful information, not a hard sell.
3.  **Clear Disclosure:** Must be clearly labeled as "Sponsored," "Ad," or "Promoted."

## Common Formats
*   **In-Feed Ads:** In social media or article feeds.
*   **Recommendation Widgets:** "Recommended for you" or "Around the web."
*   **Promoted Listings:** On sites like Amazon or Etsy.
