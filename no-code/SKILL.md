## Core Philosophy
**No-Code. Brief.** is a minimalist approach to no-code development that prioritizes clarity, simplicity, and speed over technical complexity. The goal is to solve problems and build solutions using visual tools without writing code, while maintaining extreme focus on the essential.

## Key Principles

### 1. **Problem-First Thinking**
- Start with the user's problem, not the technology
- Define the core need before choosing tools
- Eliminate unnecessary features ruthlessly

### 2. **Visual Logic Mastery**
- Map workflows visually before building
- Understand data relationships through diagrams
- Use flowcharts to design user journeys

### 3. **Tool Agnosticism**
- Choose tools based on the problem, not preference
- Master core no-code patterns that transfer between platforms
- Build solutions that can migrate if needed

### 4. **Minimalist Architecture**
- Build only what's necessary"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":216,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
