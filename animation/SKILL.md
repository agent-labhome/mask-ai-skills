## Overview

Animation is the art of creating the illusion of movement through sequenced images. This SKILL guide provides a practical roadmap from foundational principles to specialized techniques across various animation styles.

## Core Principles (The 12 Principles of Animation)

### 1. Squash and Stretch
- **Purpose**: Gives weight and flexibility to objects
- **Practice**: Animate a bouncing ball with exaggerated squash on impact and stretch during fall
- **Tip**: Maintain consistent volume throughout deformation

### 2. Anticipation
- **Purpose**: Prepares audience for an action
- **Practice**: Animate a character winding up before throwing
- **Tip**: Anticipation frames should be proportional to the following action

### 3. Staging
- **Purpose**: Clear presentation of ideas
- **Practice**: Compose shots that direct attention to the main action
- **Tip**: Use lighting, framing, and character positioning to guide the eye

### 4. Straight Ahead vs. Pose to Pose
- **Straight Ahead**: Drawing frame-by-frame sequentially (organic, spontaneous)
- **Pose to Pose**: Creating key poses first, then inbetweens (controlled, planned)
- **Practice**: Try both methods on the same simple action

### 5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action
- **Purpose**: Different parts stop at different times
- **Practice**: Animate hair/clothing continuing after character stops
- **Tip**: Secondary elements should have their own timing arcs

### 6. Slow In and Slow Out
- **Purpose**: More frames at beginning/end of movement
- **Practice**: Animate a pendulum swing with eased acceleration/deceleration
- **Tip**: Use spacing charts to plan easing

### 7. Arcs
- **Purpose**: Natural movement follows curved paths
- **Practice**: Trace the head path of a character turning
- **Tip**: Use arc guides in your"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":519,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":19},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
