## Purpose
Create clear, concise video briefs that align stakeholders and guide production teams.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Creativity** - Prioritize clear communication over clever wording
2. **Action-Oriented** - Every element should drive toward execution
3. **Audience-First** - Always define who the video is for before what it says

## Essential Components
Every video brief must include:

**1. Objective** (1 sentence)
- What measurable outcome should this video achieve?
- Example: \"Increase demo sign-ups by 15% in Q3\"

**2. Audience** (bullet points)
- Primary viewer demographics/persona
- Where they'll watch it
- What they care about

**3. Core Message** (1-2 sentences)
- The single idea viewers should remember
- What action should they take?
