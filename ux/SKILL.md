## Purpose
A UX Brief is a strategic document that aligns stakeholders around user-centered goals, constraints, and success metrics for a design project. It bridges business objectives and user needs.

## Core Structure
1. **Project Overview** – What are we building and why?
2. **Business Goals** – What does the organization need to achieve?
3. **User Goals & Problems** – Who are we helping and what challenges do they face?
4. **Scope & Constraints** – What’s in/out of scope? Timeline, budget, tech limits?
5. **Success Metrics** – How will we measure impact (e.g., usability scores, conversion)?

## Key Principles
- **Collaborative** – Co-create with stakeholders, don’t just dictate.
- **Concise** – Keep it to 1–2 pages; clarity over comprehensiveness.
- **User-Focused** – Frame problems from the user’s perspective.
