## Purpose
A UX Brief is a strategic document that aligns stakeholders around user-centered design goals, constraints, and success metrics before work begins.

## Core Components
- **Project Overview** – Context and objectives
- **Problem Statement** – What user need are we solving?
- **Target Users** – Primary personas and scenarios
- **Success Metrics** – How we'll measure impact (e.g., task completion rate, satisfaction score)
- **Constraints** – Timeline, budget, technical limitations
- **Deliverables** – Expected outputs (wireframes, prototypes, etc.)

## Key Principles
- **Collaborative** – Co-create with stakeholders
- **Concise** – 1-2 pages maximum
- **User-Focused** – Frame problems from user perspective
- **Actionable** – Clear enough to guide design decisions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Vague objectives without measurable outcomes
- Omitting technical or business constraints"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
