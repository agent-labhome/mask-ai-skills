## Core Definition
The ability to identify, analyze, and resolve issues systematically and effectively.

## Key Components
- **Analysis**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts
- **Logic & Reasoning**: Applying structured thinking to evaluate options
- **Creativity**: Generating innovative solutions beyond conventional approaches
- **Decision Making**: Selecting the best course of action with available information
- **Implementation**: Executing solutions and adapting as needed

## Essential Practices
1. **Define** the problem clearly and specifically
2. **Gather** relevant information and data
3. **Generate** multiple potential solutions
4. **Evaluate** options against criteria and constraints
5. **Select** and implement the optimal solution
6. **Review** outcomes and iterate if necessary

## Quick Tips
- Ask \"why\" repeatedly to find root causes
- Consider constraints (time, resources, scope) early
- Think in systems, not just symptoms
