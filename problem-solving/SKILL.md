## Core Definition
**Problem Solving** is the systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving challenges or obstacles to achieve desired outcomes. It involves moving from an undesired current state to a desired future state through logical reasoning, creativity, and structured methodologies.

## Key Components

### 1. **Problem Identification & Definition**
- Recognizing discrepancies between current and desired states
- Distinguishing symptoms from root causes
- Framing problems clearly and specifically
- Establishing success criteria and constraints

### 2. **Analysis & Root Cause Investigation**
- Gathering relevant data and information
- Breaking complex problems into manageable components
- Using analytical tools (5 Whys, Fishbone diagrams, Pareto analysis)
- Identifying patterns, relationships, and dependencies

### 3. **Solution Generation**
- Brainstorming multiple approaches without premature judgment
- Applying creative thinking techniques
- Drawing analogies from similar problems
- Considering both conventional and innovative solutions
