## Core Principle
A story is a sequence of events that creates meaning and evokes emotion. Your goal is to guide the audience from a beginning, through a middle, to an end, making them care about what happens.

## The 3-Act Structure (Simplified)
1.  **Setup (Beginning):** Introduce the world, the protagonist, and their normal life. Then, present an **inciting incident**—a problem or opportunity that disrupts that normalcy.
2.  **Confrontation (Middle):** The protagonist faces obstacles and makes choices to address the problem. Tension and stakes should rise. This leads to a **climax**—the decisive moment of highest tension.
3.  **Resolution (End):** Show the outcome of the climax. How has the world or the protagonist changed? Provide a sense of closure.
