## Core Principle
A story is a connected sequence of events that creates meaning and evokes emotion. Your goal is not to just inform, but to engage.

## Quick Structure: The 3-Act Spine
1.  **Hook & Context:** Start with a character (a person, team, customer) who has a desire or faces a problem. *Why should we care?*
2.  **Journey & Conflict:** Show the struggle, the choices, the obstacles. This is where tension and learning happen. *What changed or was difficult?*
3.  **Resolution & Insight:** Reveal the outcome and, most importantly, the meaning. End with a clear point, lesson, or call to action. *What does this mean for us?*

*   **Stakes:** What do they want or risk losing?
