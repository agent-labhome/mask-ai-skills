## Overview
Storytelling is the art of using narrative structure, language, and delivery to convey ideas, share experiences, or persuade an audience. It transforms abstract concepts into memorable, relatable experiences. Effective storytelling is not about embellishment but about creating meaning through structure and human connection.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Structure is Everything**
- **Beginning**: Establish context, introduce characters/situation, create a hook
- **Middle**: Present challenge, conflict, or turning point; build tension
- **End**: Provide resolution, learning, or clear takeaway
- **Universal frameworks**: Hero's Journey, Three-Act Structure, Problem-Solution-Benefit

### 2. **Know Your Audience**
- What do they care about?
- What's their existing knowledge level?
- What emotional state are they in?
- What action do you want them to take?

### 3. **Show, Don't Just Tell**
- Use specific details instead of generalizations
- Incorporate sensory language (sights, sounds, feelings)
- Share moments rather than summaries
