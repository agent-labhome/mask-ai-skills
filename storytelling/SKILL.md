## Core Principle
Communicate ideas through narrative to engage, persuade, and make information memorable.

## Key Elements
- **Hook:** Start with a compelling opening (question, surprising fact, relatable scenario).
- **Structure:** Use a clear arc: Situation → Complication → Resolution.
- **Character:** Have a protagonist (user, customer, team) with a goal.
- **Conflict:** Identify the obstacle or challenge.
- **Emotion:** Connect to human feelings (frustration, hope, joy).
- **Clarity:** One core message per story.

## Quick Framework: ABT (And, But, Therefore)
- **AND** (setup) – establishes context.
- **BUT** (conflict) – introduces the problem or twist.
- **THEREFORE** (action/resolution) – shows the outcome or solution.

## Best Practices
- **Keep it brief.** Focus on a single key insight.
- **Be specific.** Use concrete"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":216,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
