## Overview
A **Creativity Brief** is a structured document that provides essential context, constraints, and direction for a creative project. Its purpose is to align stakeholders, focus creative efforts, and establish clear success criteria—without limiting creative exploration.

## Core Principles

1.  **Clarity Over Exhaustiveness:** Be specific where it matters; leave room for interpretation where creativity thrives.
2.  **Strategic Foundation:** Connect every creative decision back to a business or communication goal.
3.  **Audience-Centric:** Define who you are speaking to, not just what you want to say.
4.  **Constraint as Catalyst:** Use limitations (budget, timeline, format) to fuel innovation, not stifle it.

## Essential Components (The \"What\")

A robust brief should answer these fundamental questions:

1.  **Background & Objective:**
    *   **Why are we doing this?** (The business problem or opportunity)
