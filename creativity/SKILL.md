## What It Is
The ability to generate novel and valuable ideas, connections, or solutions.

## How to Apply It
1.  **Reframe the Problem:** Ask \"What if?\" or \"How might we...?\" to shift perspective.
2.  **Generate, Don't Judge:** Brainstorm freely first. Quantity fuels quality.
3.  **Seek Novel Inputs:** Combine unrelated concepts, fields, or analogies.
4.  **Prototype Quickly:** Make ideas tangible to test and evolve them.

## Key Mindset
**Divergent Thinking First:** Explore many possibilities before converging on the best. Suspend the \"right answer\" instinct.

## In a Nutshell
Creativity is a disciplined process of making unexpected connections and giving yourself permission to explore."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":165,"total_tokens":180,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
