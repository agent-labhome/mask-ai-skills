## What It Is
The ability to generate novel and valuable ideas, connections, or solutions. It’s not just about art—it’s about problem-solving, innovation, and seeing possibilities others miss.

## How to Use It
*   **Reframe the Problem:** Ask \"How might we...?\" instead of \"We can't because...\"
*   **Forced Connections:** Combine two unrelated concepts to spark new ideas.
*   **Quantity First:** Brainstorm freely without judgment, then refine.
*   **Change Perspective:** View the challenge from a customer, competitor, or child's point of view.

## Quick Rules
1.  **Defer Judgment.** Separate idea generation from evaluation.
2.  **Seek Novelty.** Go for the unexpected, not just the obvious.
3.  **Build on Ideas.** Use \"yes, and...\" to develop concepts further.
4.  **Stay Brief-Focused.** Use constraints to channel creativity"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
