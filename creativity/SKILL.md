## What It Is
The ability to generate novel, valuable ideas and solutions by connecting existing concepts in new ways.

## Core Principles
- **Divergent Thinking:** Explore multiple possibilities, not just one \"right\" answer.
- **Combinatorial Play:** Merge unrelated ideas to spark innovation.
- **Constraint Embrace:** View limits as catalysts, not barriers.
- **Judgment Deferral:** Separate idea generation from evaluation.

## How to Apply (Briefly)
1.  **Reframe the Problem:** Ask \"How might we...?\" from different angles.
2.  **Generate, Don't Edit:** Rapidly produce options without initial criticism.
3.  **Seek Analogies:** Borrow concepts from unrelated fields.
4.  **Prototype Fast:** Make ideas tangible quickly to test and evolve them.

## Quick Mindset Shift
Switch from \"Is this correct?\" to \"What if...?\" and \"Could this be...?\"
