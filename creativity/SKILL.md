## Overview
Creativity is the ability to generate novel and valuable ideas, solutions, or expressions. It involves connecting disparate concepts, challenging assumptions, and thinking beyond conventional boundaries. This skill is not limited to artistic domains; it is essential for problem-solving, innovation, and strategic thinking in all fields.

## Core Principles

1.  **Divergent Thinking:** Generating multiple, varied ideas or solutions from a single starting point.
2.  **Associative Thinking:** Making connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, domains, or experiences.
3.  **Abstraction:** Stepping back from specifics to see broader patterns, principles, or metaphors.
4.  **Reframing:** Viewing a problem, situation, or object from a new perspective or within a different context.
5.  **Tolerance for Ambiguity:** Comfort with uncertainty, open-ended questions, and non-linear processes.
