# SKILL.md: Creativity. Brief.

## Core Definition
Creativity is the ability to generate novel, valuable, and actionable ideas, connections, or solutions. In a professional context, it is not about unconstrained artistic expression, but about structured innovation to solve problems, seize opportunities, and communicate effectively.

## Key Principles
1.  **Novelty & Value:** The output must be both new (to the context) and useful (solving the brief).
2.  **Divergent & Convergent Thinking:** First, expand possibilities (brainstorming, "yes, and..."). Then, critically refine and select the best options.
3.  **Constraint-Driven:** Clear constraints (budget, timeline, audience, brand) are not limitations; they are the essential framework that fuels focused creativity.
4.  **Idea is a Verb:** Creativity is an active process of making and connecting, not a passive state of waiting for inspiration.
