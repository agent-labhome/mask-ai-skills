## Detailed Skill Guide: Photography

### 1. Foundational Knowledge

#### A. Understanding Light
- **Quality:** Hard vs. soft light (direct sun vs. overcast)
- **Direction:** Front, side, back, top lighting
- **Color Temperature:** Measured in Kelvin (warm vs. cool)
- **Natural vs. Artificial:** Sunlight, strobes, continuous lights
- **Exposure Triangle:** The fundamental relationship

#### B. The Exposure Triangle
Three interdependent elements controlling light capture:

1. **Aperture (f-stop)**
   - Controls depth of field (blurred vs. sharp backgrounds)
   - Lower f-number = more light, shallower depth of field
   - Higher f-number = less light, greater depth of field
   - Typical range: f/1.4 (very wide) to f/22 (very narrow)

2. **Shutter Speed**
   - Controls motion blur vs. freeze action
   - Measured in fractions of seconds (1/500, 1/60, 1\")
   - Fast speeds freeze action (1/500+)
   - Slow speeds create motion blur (1/30 or slower)
   - Rule: Minimum handheld speed = 1/focal length

3. **ISO (Sensor Sensitivity)**
   - Controls sensor's light sensitivity
   - Lower ISO = less sensitive, less noise (100-400)
   - Higher ISO = more sensitive, more noise (800+)
   - Modern cameras perform well at higher ISOs

#### C. Camera Equipment Essentials
- **Camera Types:** DSLR, mirrorless, point-and-shoot, smartphone
- **Lens Types:**
  - Prime lenses (fixed focal length, often faster)
  - Zoom lenses (variable focal length, versatile)
  - Wide-angle (<35mm), Standard (35-70mm), Telephoto (>70mm)
