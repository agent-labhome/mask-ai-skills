## Detailed Guide to UX Research

### 1. Foundation & Principles

#### Core Philosophy
UX Research exists to bridge the gap between what organizations *think* users need and what users *actually* need. It's the systematic study of target users and their requirements to add context and insight to the design process.

#### Key Principles
- **User-Centered:** Design decisions are informed by user data, not assumptions
- **Empathy-Driven:** Understand users' perspectives, emotions, and contexts
- **Evidence-Based:** Conclusions are supported by observable data
- **Iterative:** Research is continuous throughout the product lifecycle
- **Holistic:** Considers users within their broader environment and ecosystem

#### Types of Research
- **Generative/Exploratory:** Understanding problems and user contexts (What should we build?)
- **Evaluative:** Testing solutions and prototypes (Did we build the right thing?)
- **Attitudinal:** What people say (surveys, interviews)
- **Behavioral:** What people do (analytics, observation)
- **Qualitative:** Why and how (rich insights, smaller samples)
- **Quantitative:** How many and how much (statistical significance, larger samples)

### 2. Core Methodologies

#### Discovery & Exploratory Methods
- **User Interviews:** One-on-one conversations to understand experiences, motivations, and pain points
- **Contextual Inquiry:** Observing users in their natural environment
- **Diary Studies:** Users record experiences over time to identify patterns
- **Field Studies:** Extended observation in real-world contexts
- **Competitive Analysis:** Evaluating competitors' strengths and weaknesses

#### Evaluative & Testing Methods
- **Usability Testing:** Observing users complete tasks with your product
- **A/B Testing:** Comparing two versions to see which performs better
- **Card Sorting:** Understanding how users categorize information
- **Tree Testing:** Evaluating findability in"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":519,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":19},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
