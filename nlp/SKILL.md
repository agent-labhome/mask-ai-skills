## What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and linguistics focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

## Core Components

### 1. **Text Processing**
- Tokenization (splitting text into words/sentences)
- Stemming & Lemmatization (reducing words to root forms)
- Part-of-Speech Tagging (identifying nouns, verbs, etc.)
- Named Entity Recognition (identifying people, places, organizations)

### 2. **Key Techniques**
- **Rule-based systems**: Early NLP using grammatical rules
- **Statistical NLP**: Using probability and machine learning
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks (RNNs, Transformers, BERT, GPT)

### 3. **Common Tasks**
- **Classification**: Sentiment analysis, spam detection
