## Core Principles
- **Clarity First** - Subject lines and opening sentences should state purpose immediately
- **Brevity** - Keep emails concise; aim for 5 sentences or less when possible
- **Action-Oriented** - Make requests clear and deadlines explicit
- **Professional Tone** - Formal enough for context, but avoid unnecessary jargon

## Structure
1. **Subject Line** - Specific and informative (e.g., \"Q3 Report Feedback - Action Required by Friday\")
2. **Opening** - State purpose in first sentence
3. **Body** - Key information only, bullet points for multiple items
4. **Closing** - Clear call-to-action or next steps
5. **Signature** - Professional, consistent format

## Best Practices
- **Timing** - Send during recipient's working hours
- **Recipients** - Use CC/BCC judiciously; avoid unnecessary \"Reply All\"
- **Attachments"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":215,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
