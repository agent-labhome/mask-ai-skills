## Purpose
Transform verbose email threads into concise, actionable summaries that capture key decisions, action items, and context.

## Core Principles
- **Essentialism**: Extract only what matters—decisions, actions, deadlines, owners
- **Clarity**: Use plain language, avoid jargon and email fluff
- **Action-orientation**: Structure around what needs to happen next
- **Context preservation**: Maintain important background without reproducing entire thread

## Input Analysis
**Identify in source emails:**
- Key decisions made
- Action items (with owners and deadlines)
- Open questions requiring response
- Important context or constraints
- Changes from previous positions
- Attachments or references to review
