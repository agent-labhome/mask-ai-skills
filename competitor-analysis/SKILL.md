## Purpose
Systematically identify, evaluate, and track competitors to inform strategic decisions, identify market opportunities, and mitigate threats.

## Core Principles

1. **Objective Perspective**: Analyze without bias; focus on facts and observable data.
2. **Continuous Process**: Competitor landscapes are dynamic; analysis should be ongoing, not a one-time event.
3. **Actionable Focus**: Insights must lead to specific strategic or tactical recommendations.
4. **Holistic View**: Consider direct, indirect, and potential competitors, not just obvious rivals.

## Process Framework

### Phase 1: Identification & Scoping
- **Define Market Boundaries**: What space are we competing in? (Geographic, product category, customer segment)
- **Identify Competitor Types**:
  - **Direct**: Offer similar products/services to the same target audience.
  - **Indirect**: Solve the same customer problem with a different solution.
  - **Potential**: Companies not currently competing"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":216,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
