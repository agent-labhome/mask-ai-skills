## Overview
Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology for eliminating defects and reducing variation in business processes. Originally developed by Motorola in the 1980s, it combines statistical analysis with structured problem-solving to achieve near-perfect quality (3.4 defects per million opportunities).

## Core Methodology: DMAIC

### 1. DEFINE Phase
**Objective**: Clearly articulate the problem, project goals, and customer requirements.

**Key Tools & Deliverables:**
- **Project Charter**: Documents business case, problem statement, goals, scope, timeline, and team
- **Voice of Customer (VOC)**: Gather customer requirements through surveys, interviews, complaints
- **SIPOC Diagram**: High-level process map showing Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers
- **CTQ Tree**: Translates customer needs into Critical-to-Quality measurable requirements

**Business Application Example:**
- *Problem*: Customer service call resolution time exceeds industry benchmark
- *Goal*: Reduce average resolution time from 15 to 8 minutes within 6 months
- *Scope*: Technical support calls for Product X, excluding billing inquiries

### 2. MEASURE Phase
**Objective**: Quantify the current process performance and establish baseline metrics.

**Key Tools & Deliverables:**
- **Data Collection Plan**: What, where, when, and how to collect data
- **Process Mapping**: Detailed flowchart of current process steps
- **Measurement System Analysis (MSA)**: Ensure measurement tools are accurate and precise
- **Capability Analysis**: Calculate current sigma level (Cp, Cpk)
- **Baseline Performance**: Defects per million opportunities (DPMO), yield, cycle time

**Business Application Example:**
- Collect data on 500 support calls over 2 weeks
- Measure: Call duration, hold time, transfer count,"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":522,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":22},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
