## Name
**Bitcoin Savings Plan** – A systematic, disciplined approach to accumulating Bitcoin over time.

## Description
The Bitcoin Savings Plan is a strategy for regularly purchasing Bitcoin regardless of market conditions, similar to a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach. Instead of trying to time the market, users commit to buying a fixed dollar amount or a fixed amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly). This method reduces the impact of volatility, removes emotional decision-making, and builds a long-term Bitcoin position steadily.

## Features
- **Automated Purchases**: Schedule recurring buys (e.g., every Friday, 1st of the month).
- **Fixed Amount or Fixed Bitcoin**: Option to buy a set dollar amount (e.g., $50/week) or a set amount of Bitcoin (e.g., 0.001 BTC/month).
- **Customizable Frequency**: Choose intervals that match cash flow (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly).
- **Volatility Smoothing**: Averages purchase price over time, lowering risk of buying at a single high price.
- **Discipline & Habit Formation**: Encourages consistent investing behavior.
- **Low Time Commitment**: “Set and forget” – requires minimal ongoing attention.
- **Self-Custody Integration**: Option to automatically transfer purchases to a private wallet (hardware, mobile, or desktop).
- **Progress Tracking**: View total Bitcoin accumulated, average cost basis, and growth over"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":26,"completion_tokens":300,"total_tokens":326,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":26},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
