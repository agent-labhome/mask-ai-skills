## Practical Guide: Mastering SaaS Pricing Strategy

### 1. Foundational Concepts (Week 1-2)

**Core Pricing Models to Understand:**
- **Per-User Pricing**: Charge per seat/user (e.g., Slack, Notion)
- **Usage-Based Pricing**: Charge based on consumption (e.g., AWS, Twilio)
- **Tiered Pricing**: Multiple packages with feature differentiation (e.g., HubSpot)
- **Freemium**: Free basic version, paid premium features (e.g., Zoom, Dropbox)
- **Flat-Rate**: Single price for all features (e.g., Basecamp)

**Key Metrics to Calculate:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC Ratio (aim for 3:1 or higher)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Churn Rate (both customer and revenue)

### 2. Research Phase (Week 3-4)

**Competitive Analysis Framework:**
1. Identify 5-7 direct and adjacent competitors
2. Document their pricing pages (screenshot and notes)
3. Map their feature matrices
4. Note their positioning language
5. Track any pricing changes over time (use Wayback Machine)

**Customer Value Research:**
- Conduct 10+ customer interviews asking:
  - \"What's the biggest problem this solves for you?\"
  - \"How would you solve this if our product didn't exist?\"
  - \"What would happen if you couldn't use this for a month?\"
- Survey 50+ potential customers with Van Westendorp's Price Sensitivity Meter questions

### 3. Pricing Structure Design (Week 5-6)

**Building Your Pricing Page:**
1. **Anchor with highest price first** (psychologically makes other options seem more reasonable)
2. **Limit choices to 3-4 tiers** (paradox of choice - too many options reduce conversions)
3. **Create clear value progression** between tiers
