# Viral Growth

## Definition
Viral growth is a growth pattern where existing users of a product or service actively and organically recruit new users, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of adoption. This is typically measured by the **viral coefficient (K-factor)**, which quantifies how many new users each existing user brings in.

## Core Concept

### Viral Coefficient (K-Factor)
The fundamental metric for viral growth is calculated as:

**K = i × c**

Where:
- **i** = Number of invites sent per user
- **c** = Conversion rate of those invites

**Interpretation:**
- **K < 1**: Growth decays over time (non-viral"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":250,"total_tokens":266,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
