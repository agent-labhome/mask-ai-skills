# Design System Expertise

## Overview
I specialize in creating, maintaining, and scaling design systems that bridge the gap between design and development. My approach focuses on systematic thinking, consistency at scale, and creating shared language across product teams.

## Core Competencies

### 1. **Design System Strategy & Governance**
- Establishing design system vision and roadmap
- Defining contribution models and adoption strategies
- Creating governance frameworks and decision-making processes
- Measuring system impact through adoption metrics and ROI analysis

### 2. **Design Token Architecture**
- Structuring token hierarchies (global"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":250,"total_tokens":266,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":16},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
