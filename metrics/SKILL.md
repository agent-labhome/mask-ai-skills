## Metadata
- **Name:** Metrics
- **Category:** Data Analysis & Measurement
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **Prerequisites:** Basic statistics, data literacy, domain knowledge
- **Related Skills:** Data Visualization, KPI Design, Business Intelligence, Statistical Analysis
- **Time to Basic Proficiency:** 2-4 months
- **Time to Advanced Proficiency:** 1-2 years

## Overview
Metrics are quantifiable measures used to track, monitor, and assess the status of specific processes, activities, or outcomes. They serve as the foundation for data-driven decision-making, performance management, and continuous improvement across all domains—from business and technology to healthcare and education.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Metric Types
- **Leading Indicators:** Predictive metrics that forecast future outcomes (e.g., sales pipeline value)
- **Lagging Indicators:** Outcome metrics that reflect historical performance (e.g., quarterly revenue)
- **Quantitative Metrics:** Numerical measurements (e.g., conversion rate, error count)
- **Qualitative Metrics:** Subjective assessments often scored or categorized (e.g., customer satisfaction scores)
- **Input Metrics:** Measure resources or efforts invested (e.g., marketing spend, training hours)
- **Process Metrics:** Measure efficiency of activities (e.g., cycle time, throughput)
- **Output Metrics:** Measure results or deliverables (e.g., units produced, features shipped)
- **Outcome Metrics:** Measure impact on goals (e.g., revenue growth, customer retention)

### 2. Metric Characteristics (SMART+)
- **Specific:** Clearly defined and unambiguous
- **Measurable:** Quantifiable with available data
- **Actionable:** Tied to decisions or interventions
- **Relevant:** Aligned with strategic objectives
- **Time-bound:** Associated with a specific period
- **Comparable:** Can be benchmarked against targets or historical data
- **Understandable:** Easily interpreted by stakeholders

### 3. Common Metric Frameworks
- **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):** Goal-setting framework with measurable outcomes
- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):** Critical metrics for organizational health
- **Balanced Scorecard:** Multi-perspective performance measurement
- **North Star Metric:** Single primary metric that captures core value delivery
- **HEART Framework (Google):** Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task Success
