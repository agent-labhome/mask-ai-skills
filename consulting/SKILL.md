## Core Competency
Structuring ambiguous client problems into actionable, strategic frameworks that drive clarity and measurable outcomes.

## Key Principles

### 1. Problem Definition
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Distinguish symptoms from underlying issues
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify all affected parties and their interests
- **Scope Discipline**: Define what's in/out of scope to prevent mission creep
- **Assumption Surfacing**: Make implicit beliefs explicit and testable

### 2. Information Synthesis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Connect disparate data points into coherent narratives
- **Hypothesis-Driven Approach**: Formulate testable propositions early
- **Evidence Hierarchy**: Prioritize primary sources over secondary/tertiary
- **Contradiction Resolution**: Acknowledge and reconcile conflicting information

### 3. Framework Application
- **Tool Selection**: Match analytical frameworks to problem characteristics
- **Customization**: Adapt standard models to specific context
