## Purpose
A consulting brief is a foundational document that outlines the scope, objectives, and parameters of a consulting engagement. It serves as a formal agreement and roadmap between the consultant and the client, ensuring alignment, managing expectations, and providing a clear framework for the project's execution and success.

## Core Components

A comprehensive consulting brief should address the following key areas:

### 1. Situation & Background
*   **Current State:** Describe the client's organization, the relevant department/team, and the specific context of the issue.
*   **The Challenge/Opportunity:** Clearly articulate the problem to be solved, the opportunity to be captured, or the pain point being experienced. Use data and specific examples where possible.
*   **Drivers for Change:** Explain why this initiative is necessary now (e.g., market shifts, internal inefficiencies, competitive threats, strategic goals).

### 2. Objectives & Desired Outcomes
