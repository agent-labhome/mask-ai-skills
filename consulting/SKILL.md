## Purpose
To rapidly capture and structure client needs into a clear, actionable consulting brief that aligns expectations and defines success.

## Core Components

2. **Objective** – Desired outcome and success metrics
3. **Scope** – What’s in/out of bounds
4. **Stakeholders** – Key decision-makers and influencers
5. **Constraints** – Timeline, budget, resources
6. **Deliverables** – Tangible outputs and format

## Key Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness** – Use plain language
- **Specificity over generality** – Quantify where possible
- **Alignment over assumption** – Validate with stakeholders
- **Actionability over abstraction** – Every element should drive next steps
