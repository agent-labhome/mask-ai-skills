2.  **Structured Problem-Solving:** Using frameworks and methodologies to break down complex, ambiguous problems.
3.  **Evidence-Based Recommendations:** Basing advice on data, research, and analysis, not just opinion.
4.  **Effective Communication:** Translating complex findings into clear, actionable insights for diverse audiences.
5.  **Ethical Practice:** Maintaining confidentiality, avoiding conflicts of interest, and providing honest counsel.
