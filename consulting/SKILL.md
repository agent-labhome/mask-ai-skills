## Overview
Consulting is the practice of providing expert advice to organizations or individuals to solve specific problems, improve performance, or facilitate change. It involves diagnosing issues, developing solutions, and guiding implementation, all while managing client relationships and expectations.

## Core Principles

1.  **Client-Centricity:** The client's success and objectives are the ultimate measure of value.
2.  **Structured Problem-Solving:** Using frameworks and methodologies to break down complex, ambiguous problems.
3.  **Evidence-Based Recommendations:** Basing advice on data, research, and analysis, not just opinion.
4.  **Effective Communication:** Translating complex findings into clear, actionable insights for diverse audiences.
5.  **Ethical Practice:** Maintaining confidentiality, avoiding conflicts of interest, and providing honest counsel.
