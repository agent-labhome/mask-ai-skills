## Purpose
Create concise, actionable security briefs that communicate risks, mitigations, and decisions to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Key Principles

**Clarity Over Completeness**
- Lead with executive summary (1-2 sentences)
- Use plain language; explain technical terms
- Focus on what matters for decision-making

**Action-Oriented**
- Every risk must have associated mitigation
- Include clear recommendations with rationale
- Specify owners and timelines where applicable

**Risk-Contextualized**
- Frame in business impact, not just technical severity
- Include likelihood and potential damage
- Reference compliance/regulatory implications
