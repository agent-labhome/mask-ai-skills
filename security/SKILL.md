## Purpose
To create concise, actionable security briefings that communicate essential security information to stakeholders in a clear, structured format.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Audience-Centric**
- Identify the target audience (executives, technical teams, general staff)
- Tailor language, depth, and focus accordingly
- Answer \"What do they need to know?\" and \"What do they need to do?\"

### 2. **Clarity Over Completeness**
- Prioritize the most critical information
- Use plain language, avoid unnecessary jargon
- Focus on impact and action over technical minutiae

### 3. **Structured Communication**
- Follow a consistent format for easy scanning
- Use clear headings and visual hierarchy
- Present information in logical flow
