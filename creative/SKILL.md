## Purpose
A concise, structured document that translates business objectives into clear creative direction for marketing, design, and content teams.

## Core Components
1. **Background & Objectives** - Why this project exists and what it must achieve.
2. **Target Audience** - Who we're speaking to and what matters to them.
3. **Key Message & Tone** - What to say and how to say it.
4. **Deliverables & Specifications** - What needs to be created and technical requirements.
5. **Timeline & Budget** - Practical constraints and deadlines.

## Best Practices
- Start with the business problem, not the creative solution
- Be specific about what success looks like (KPIs)
- Include competitive context and market insights
- Balance strategic direction with creative freedom
- Keep it succinct—1-2 pages maximum for most projects
