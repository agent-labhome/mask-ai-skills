## Metadata
- **Skill Name**: Waterfall Methodology
- **Category**: Project Management
- **Subcategory**: Traditional/Plan-Driven
- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate
- **Estimated Study Time**: 2-4 hours
- **Prerequisites**: Basic project management concepts
- **Related Skills**: Agile, Scrum, PRINCE2, PMP

## Overview
Waterfall is a linear, sequential project management methodology where project phases flow downward like a waterfall. Each phase must be completed before the next begins, with minimal overlap between stages. Originally developed for manufacturing and construction, it became widely adopted in software development and other industries.

## Core Principles

### 1. Sequential Phases
- Strictly defined phases that follow in sequence
- No phase begins until the previous one is complete
- Each phase has specific deliverables and review processes

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation
- Extensive documentation at each phase
- Requirements are frozen early in the process
- Changes are difficult and costly to implement later

### 3. Fixed Scope and Requirements
- Requirements are gathered and finalized upfront
- Scope is defined before development begins
- Changes require formal change control procedures

### 4. Emphasis on Planning
- Detailed planning occurs before execution
- Timeline, budget, and resources are determined early
- Risk management focuses on anticipating problems

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering & Analysis
**Objective**: Define what the project will deliver
- **Activities**:
  - Stakeholder interviews and workshops
  - Business requirement documentation
  - Functional and non-functional requirements specification
  - Requirement validation and sign-off
- **Deliverables**: Requirements Specification Document (RSD)
- **Key Considerations**: Requirements must be complete, clear, and testable

### Phase 2: System Design
**Objective**: Determine how the system will meet requirements
- **Activities**:
  - High-level system architecture design
  - Detailed technical specifications
  - Database design
  - Interface design
  - Technology stack selection
- **Deliverables**: System Design Document (SDD)
- **Key Considerations**: Design should be comprehensive enough for implementation

### Phase 3: Implementation
**Objective**: Build the system according to design
- **Activities**:
  - Coding/development
  - Unit testing
  - Integration of components
  - Technical documentation
- **Deliver"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":519,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":19},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
