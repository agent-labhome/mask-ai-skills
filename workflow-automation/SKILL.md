## Core Concepts

### 1. Process Analysis
- **Process Mapping**: Documenting current workflows using flowcharts or BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)

- **Scheduled**: Run processes at regular intervals (daily reports, data syncs)
- **Conditional**: Execute different paths based on data or rules
- **Parallel Processing**: Handle multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Error Handling**: Implement retries, alerts, and fallback procedures

### 3. Integration Methods
- **API Connections**: Direct integration with software APIs
- **Webhooks**: Real-time data transmission between applications
