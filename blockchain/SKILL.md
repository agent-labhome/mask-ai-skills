## Practical Skill Development Path

### Phase 1: Foundational Understanding (Weeks 1-4)
**Core Concepts:**
- What is blockchain? (Distributed ledger, immutability, decentralization)
- How blocks are structured and chained
- Consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake)
- Public vs. private blockchains
- Cryptography basics: hashing, digital signatures

**Practical Exercises:**
1. Create a simple blockchain in Python:
   ```python
   import hashlib
   import json
   from datetime import datetime
   
   class Block:
       def __init__(self, index, timestamp, data, previous_hash):
           self.index = index
           self.timestamp = timestamp
           self.data = data
           self.previous_hash = previous_hash"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":300,"total_tokens":317,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":17},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
