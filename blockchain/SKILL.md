## Overview
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant recording of transactions across a network of computers. It forms the foundation for cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and various enterprise solutions.

## Core Concepts

### Foundational Principles
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control; network maintained by multiple participants (nodes)
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be altered without network consensus
- **Transparency**: All transactions are visible to network participants (with varying privacy models)
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Protocols that ensure all nodes agree on the ledger's state
- **Cryptographic Security**: Uses hashing and digital signatures to secure data

### Key Components
- **Blocks**: Containers for transaction data
- **Chains**: Cryptographic links between blocks
- **Nodes**: Network participants that maintain the blockchain
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing code on the"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":14,"completion_tokens":200,"total_tokens":214,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":14},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
