## Metadata
- **Skill Category**: Research & Validation
- **Complexity Level**: Intermediate
- **Time Required**: 2-8 hours (depending on scope)
- **Team Involvement**: Can be solo or collaborative
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of target users, product/prototype to test
- **Outputs**: Insights document, video recordings, prioritized issues, actionable recommendations

## Overview
User testing is a research method where real users interact with your product, service, or prototype while you observe, listen, and learn about their experience. The goal is to identify usability problems, understand user behavior and preferences, and validate design decisions before development or launch.

## Detailed Guide

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 hours)

#### 1. Define Objectives
- **What do you want to learn?** Be specific:
  - Can users complete core tasks successfully?
  - Where do they encounter confusion or frustration?
  - How long does it take to complete key actions?
  - What are users' emotional responses?
  - Are there accessibility barriers?

#### 2. Identify Target Participants
- **Recruit 5-8 participants** per user segment (Nielsen Norman Group research shows this uncovers 85% of usability issues)
- **Screening criteria** should match your actual users:
  - Demographics (age, location, etc.)
  - Tech proficiency
  - Relevant experience/behaviors
  - Device usage patterns

#### 3. Create Test Scenarios & Tasks
- **Write realistic scenarios** that mimic actual use cases
- **Tasks should be specific but not instructional**:
  - ❌ \"Click the settings icon\"
  - ✅ \"Change your notification preferences\"
- **Order tasks** from simple to complex
- **Include 3-5 core tasks** (45-60 minute session maximum)

#### 4. Choose Testing Method
| Method | Best For | Tools Needed |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Moderated In-Person** | Deep qualitative insights, observing body language | Space, recording equipment |
| **Moderated Remote** | Geographical diversity, convenience | Zoom, Lookback, UserTesting.com |
| **Unmoderated Remote** | Larger sample sizes, quantitative data | UserTesting.com, Maze, UsabilityHub |
| **Guerilla Testing** | Quick, low-cost early feedback |"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":500,"total_tokens":519,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":19},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
