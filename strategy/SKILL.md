## Purpose
A concise document that defines the strategic approach for an initiative, project, or campaign. It aligns stakeholders on objectives, scope, and direction before detailed planning begins.

## Core Components
1. **Objective** – Clear, measurable goal
2. **Context** – Why this matters now
3. **Target Audience** – Who we’re addressing
4. **Key Insights** – Data or observations driving the approach
5. **Strategic Approach** – High-level path to achieve the objective
6. **Success Metrics** – How we’ll measure impact
7. **Constraints & Assumptions** – Known limitations and beliefs

## Key Principles
- **Concise** – Typically 1–2 pages; avoids exhaustive detail
- **Aligned** – Ensures shared understanding across teams
- **Actionable** – Provides enough direction for next-step planning
- **Evidence-informed** – Grounded in data or research
