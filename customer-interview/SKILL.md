# Customer Interview

## Metadata
- **Name:** Customer Interview
- **Description:** A structured process for conducting effective customer interviews to gather insights, validate assumptions, and understand user needs, pain points, and behaviors.
- **Triggers:**
  - Starting discovery for a new product/feature
  - Need to validate a product hypothesis or assumption
  - Preparing for user research or design sprint
  - Receiving ambiguous customer feedback requiring deeper exploration
  - Before defining product requirements or user stories

## Overview
This skill provides a framework for planning, conducting, and analyzing customer interviews. Effective interviews move beyond surface-level feedback to uncover deeper motivations, contexts, and unmet needs.

## Core Principles

### 1. Objective-First Approach
- **Define clear goals:** What do you need to learn? (e.g., validate problem, understand workflow, identify frustrations)
- **Focus on discovery, not validation:** Seek to understand, not to confirm your existing beliefs.
- **Limit assumptions:** Enter interviews with curiosity, not solutions.

### 2. Participant Selection
- **Target the right users:** Recruit participants who match your target persona or user segment.
- **Diversity matters:** Include varied experience"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":250,"total_tokens":272,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":22},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}
