## Practical Guide to Technical SEO

### 1. Foundation & Understanding

**What is Technical SEO?**
Technical SEO refers to the process of optimizing a website's infrastructure so search engines can crawl, index, and understand its content efficiently. It's the foundation upon which all other SEO efforts are built.

**Core Objectives:**
- Ensure search engines can **discover** your pages
- Help search engines **understand** your content and structure
- Provide a **fast, secure, and accessible** user experience
- Establish **website authority** and trust signals

### 2. Core Technical SEO Checklist

#### A. Crawling & Indexing
- **Robots.txt:** Audit your `/robots.txt` file to ensure you're not accidentally blocking important pages or resources.
- **XML Sitemaps:** Create and submit comprehensive XML sitemaps to search engines via Google Search Console. Ensure they're updated regularly.
- **Index Coverage:** Regularly check Google Search Console's Index Coverage report for errors (404s, server errors, blocked by robots.txt).
- **Canonicalization:** Implement proper `rel=\"canonical\"` tags to avoid duplicate content issues.
- **URL Structure:** Create clean, logical, and descriptive URLs (e.g., `/blog/technical-seo-guide` vs `/p=1234`).

#### B. Website Performance & Core Web Vitals
- **Page Speed:** Aim for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s, First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms, Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1.
- **Mobile-First:** Ensure complete responsiveness and mobile usability.
- **Optimize Assets:** Compress images (WebP/AVIF format), minify CSS/JS, leverage browser caching.
- **Hosting & CDN:** Use reliable hosting and a Content Delivery Network for global audiences.
